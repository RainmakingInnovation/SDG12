aid:tech,blockchain-based cash transfers for refugees,We started AIDTech to offer better transparency in international aid and support services for refugees migrants and those in need. We want to offer a solution to the problem of financial inclusion for those who are currently excluded from public financial and digital services because they are unbanked or undocumented. Using blockchain based technology allows for direct entitlements and complete traceability and transparency. The problem we are solving is firstly that of financial inclusion. Once a beneficiary is registered on our platform via our partners such as the Red Cross the UN or governmental welfare depts they gain a access to a diverse variety of services. Through access to an accredited personal profile beneficiary can lay claim to services such as capital insurance pensions donations and remittances. This serves as the basis towards more equitable basic human rights and access. Using the example of a smallholding farmer by establishing a legal identity (SDG 16.9) documented on the blockchain their profile serves to host entitlements such as land registry records insurance and remittances.

AquaSprouts,We design products that bring aquaponics & hydroponics into any environment,"AquaSprouts® designs and manufactures gardening appliances to bring the revolutionary principles of aquaponic and hydroponic farming into the home, office, and classroom. In the current market it is difficult for average households to grow their own food. With the rise of food insecurity and the organic movement, much of society is showing an interest in localizing food production. However, many consumers do not have the space or time for a garden, despite the desire to supplement food they buy with food they grow. This increased focus on sustainability is also leading to a reexamination of our current agriculture systems. Alternative forms of agriculture like aquaponics and hydroponics are more sustainable than traditional farming, but do not yet boast mainstream success. When it comes to adopting new technology, educational institutions are vital for encouraging this adoption and inspiring the next generation of innovators. We started AquaSprouts® to solve these problems by producing turnkey aquaponic and hydroponic systems built for homes and classrooms. Households and consumers are able to use our cutting edge products to subsidize their food costs, exercise sustainability, and connect with nature in a refreshingly modern way. At the same time, students and teachers are able to use our products and educational materials as a hands-on learning tool to illustrate a variety of scientific and ecological concepts in a novel way that puts alternative forms of agriculture at the forefront.

aqutonix,water efficiency gives more crop per drop,"aqutonix is a water efficiency enhancement technology that facilitates the absorption of the water in plants’ roots, reducing water consumption and boosting yields. due to water’s chemical properties, molecules tend to group together in ‘clusters’ which have to be broken down by the plant before the individual molecules can be absorbed through the roots’ cell walls. aqutonix’s technology facilitates water absorption through exposure to a high voltage electric field which breaks the clusters down, making individual molecules available to plants. increasing absorption rates means that less water is required, resulting in water savings for farmers. what’s more, the product increases the photosynthetic efficiency of plants – because the water molecules are broken down before they are consumed by the plant, it leaves the plant more energy for photosynthesis. this process has been shown to increase yields by up to 43% . the device is compatible with existing commercial irrigation systems, making it easy to install. although it runs on electricity, it requires very little, around 500 watts per hour. the company expects that savings on water usage will make up for the extra energy costs, and may reduce them overall if farms have to irrigate less. why you should care agriculture is currently responsible for 70% of global freshwater consumption. what’s more, agricultural run-off from inefficient irrigation and excessive use of fertilisers and pesticides can contaminate groundwater and freshwater sources. aqutonix can help overcome these issues by cutting water consumption and reliance on agricultural chemicals.",http://aqutonix.com/,SDG 2: Zero Hunger,,2.1 AgTech for Sustainable Farming,,,,,,,,United States of America,Go-to-market,Nascent,No,Unfunded,Not Applicable,N/A,,High income,South Korea,,2016,Unknown,,,,,,Sustainia,TRUE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,0.5,0,1,0.2,Nascent,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Asaduru,Creating sustainable buildings using rammed earth and cleantech solutions,"Today buildings consume at least 32% of global energy and the construction industry stand for 24% of total GHG-emissions (UN-habitat). However, if the embodied energy of construction materials is included, the share of the building sector is significantly higher and becomes the leading GHG emitter (up to 40% of energy consumption and 30% of GHG emissions). Because of this, the design and construction of buildings have a significant effect on the probabilities of meeting the 2°C target. AsaDuru enables African property developers to create self-sufficient housing communities using rammed earth construction, delivered through an exclusive partnership with the market-leading company Earth Structures Group. Their proprietary formworks allows us to build rammed earth walls, as subcontractors using local and sustainable materials, significantly faster than the closest competitor, while developing our own IP. Rammed earth is one of the most sustainable wall building techniques available (BREEAM A+) with low embodied energy (70% less than fired bricks) and a high thermal mass. Local soil is packed layer by layer within a formwork to create durable, load-bearing walls. In certain markets, such as Kenya, our rammed earth system is already significantly cheaper than the cheapest alternatives (concrete blocks & bricks). AsaDuru will build on this foundation by including solutions that allow a holistic approach to building, including wastewater treatment, rainwater harvesting and renewable energy. Combined, these elements will build homes which produce their own water and energy and deal with their own waste. This is a concept we are calling NZero. These components are sourced from carefully selected partners with regards to quality of technology, costs, track-record and appropriateness within the market. We will create a holistic package, with a range of pre designed housing modules, which can be easily reproduced across the African continent and around the globe.",http://www.AsaDuru.com,SDG 13: Climate Action,,13.5 Decarbonised Buildings,,,,,,,,South Africa,Prototype,Nascent,No,Unfunded,Not Applicable,N/A,,Upper middle income,South Africa,,2014,4,,,,,,IKEA Bootcamp,TRUE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,0.5,0,0,0.2,Nascent,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CO2 Revolution,Revolución tecnológica contra el cambio climático. Creamos ecosistemas mediante semillas inteligentes (iseed) lanzadas en drones,"El cambio climático es uno de los mayores, quizá el mayor, problema al que se enfrenta la humanidad. Las principales causas del mismo son la emisión de gases de efecto invernadero y la deforestación masiva. Solucionar estas dos causas pasa a ser uno de los principales objetivos globales si queremos que la vida, tal cual la conocemos, no cambie de forma drástica en las próximas décadas. Nuestro producto / servicio intenta dar una solución que ataca a la raíz de ambas causas, aplicando un método de innovación tecnológica para crear ecosistemas a gran escala. Ecosistemas que por una parte recuperen, mediante su proceso natural, enormes cantidades de carbono en estado gaseoso de la atmósfera y lo transformen en estado sólido y por otra, reforesten enormes cantidades de terreno deforestado para que anualmente la superficie total neta forestada tenga saldo positivo. Hemos concebido la creación de un ecosistema analizando todas las variables que interviene en la creación del mismo, como si de la línea de producción de una fábrica se tratase, eliminado todos los cuellos de botella generalmente ligados a tiempo y dinero El sistema consta de 4 fases: 1. Big Data. Se trata de un programa informático, que mediante algoritmos selecciona de unas enormes bases de datos las variables más apropiadas para el nuevo ecosistema. Se analizan y seleccionan variables tales como temperatura, precipitaciones, tipos de suelo, especies autóctonas, requerimientos de las poblaciones locales y las optimiza y ajusta para crear ecosistemas armónicos, sostenibles y productivos. 2. Iseed (semilla inteligente). Innovación mundial. Se trata de una semilla pregerminada, a la que se saca de su periodo de latencia, la cual se introduce dentro de una cápsula biodegradable a la que se añaden todos los elementos que necesita dicha semilla para que tenga viabilidad en su primera fase de crecimiento, que es la más crítica. Se añaden elementos como enraizantes, abonos orgánicos, repelentes para posibles depredadores o polímeros superabsorventes que aumentan hasta 500 veces su tamaño en contacto con agua y que hacen que no falte humedad a la futura planta. Eficiencia superior al 80%. 3. Drones. La plantación se realiza mediante drones, que llevan adosados unos depósitos que pueden albergar hasta 2500 de nuestras Iseed en cada vuelo. El lanzamiento de cada Iseedla realiza en dron siguiendo lo diseñado y marcado por el Big Data (apartado 1). Apoyado en la guía GPS, los mapas cartografiados y su software propio va realizando el lanzamiento de cada Iseed de forma autónoma. Un sólo dron puede plantar más de 25000 potenciales árboles en un sólo día, algo inimaginable a día de hoy. 4. Plataforma digital.

Time, money, and plastic are resources that are wasted on a daily basis, solely to get waste bins ready for new waste, only to repeat the process. At least once a day, large campuses with thousands of restrooms transports waste bags to overfilled utility rooms. Some even do this multiple times a day at high-traffic restrooms.

chirps chips,healthy cookies and chips from cricket flour,"chirps chips uses flour made from crickets to create tortilla-style chip snacks that are nutritious and eco-friendly. using crickets milled into a flour to make tortilla chips, chirps chips’ snacks are healthy and have a low environmental impact. the company’s tortilla chips, called “chirps”, are made of beans, chia seeds, corn, peas and cricket flour, and they come in three flavors: cheddar, barbeque, and sea salt. with this combination of ingredients, the chips are low in fat, high in protein and also contain a number of other nutrients. in the future, the company plans to expand its offerings and normalize cricket-based food as a healthy alternative to meat. crickets are 70% protein, and the flour derived from them is high in calcium and iron. aside from being a healthier flour alternative, producing cricket flour is also better for the planet than meat, as crickets are 12 times more efficient in converting feed to food than cattle. why you should care according to the food and agriculture organisation of the united nations (fao), the livestock sector is responsible for 14.5% of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions . embracing cricket protein is one way to reduce the environmental footprint of the food sector, as insects generate only 1% of the greenhouse gases that livestock produce . chirps chips seeks to spur this shift by normalizing cricket consumption and showcasing insects as a healthy, affordable and sustainable solution.",https://eatchirps.com/,SDG 2: Zero Hunger,,2.4 New Protein Sources,,,,,,,,United States of America,Unknown,Nascent,Yes,Seed,"390,000",N/A,,High income,USA,,2014,8,,,,,,Sustainia,TRUE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,0.5,0,0,0.2,Nascent,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Climeworks,Commercialises a highly energy efficient technology for CO2 capture from air,"climeworks has developed a way to capture carbon dioxide directly from the air. the concentrated gas is then either sold for commercial products such as carbonated beverages, or safely buried to directly reduce atmospheric concentrations. climeworks’ direct air capture technology captures co2 from ambient air with a patented filter, in a device called the ‘co2 collector’. air is drawn into the collector, and the co2 within the air is chemically bound to the filter. once the filter is saturated with co2 it is heated to around 100°c, which causes the co2 to be released from the filter so it can be collected as highly concentrated co2 gas. the remaining co2-free air is released back into the atmosphere. the concentrated co2 gas is either sold for commercial applications such as carbonated drinks, agriculture and alternative fuels, or it is safely sequestered in icelandic rock formations, contributing to the removal of co2 from the atmosphere. climeworks plants are modular, scalable and can be mass-produced, enabling deployment on a large scale. because the plants capture co2 from air, they can be built anywhere, independently of any existing infrastructure. why you should care the paris agreement signed by 196 nations in 2015 agreed to keep the global average increase in temperatures to ‘well below two degrees celsius’, but the un environment’s ‘ gap report ’ suggests that even with the pledges to cut emissions that have been made so far, we are unlikely to meet the target. this suggests there could be an even more significant role for carbon capture technologies going forward.",http://www.climeworks.com,SDG 13: Climate Action,,n/a,,,Direct,energy,,,,,,Mature,Yes,Series D,"124,870,000",,Aug/2018,,Switzerland,,2009,97,,,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,1,0.66,0.5,0.796,Mature,,,,#REF!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jiro-Ve,To provide access to renewable energy in Madagascar.,Started one year ago Jiro Ve is a social enterprise that already serves 1000 families with solar products in three small towns in Madagascar. Every evening a charged up lamp is delivered to a family s doorstep by a local franchisee. In the morning the lamps are again collected and charged up using solar power. During our first year we have learned a lot and developed an innovative franchised business model that allows us to grow in a sustainable way. Currently Jiro Ve is already profitable but requires capital to scale further in order to accomplish our mission to light up at least 50000 families within the next 5 years. In Madagascar over 145 million people remain without electricity and are too poor to buy solar products directly. It is therefore our objective to make an affordable service available in a profitable scalable manner.

dyecoo,waterless dyeing of textiles using co2,"dyecoo offers a co2-based dyeing technology that eliminates the need for water and processing chemicals in the dyeing process of fabrics and also reduces energy consumption. this technology uses co2 for dyeing polyester fabrics, and has already been embraced by major brands such as ikea and nike. dyecoo textile systems release liquid co2 into the dye vessels of the machine, where heat and pressure transform the liquid co2 into a supercritical fluid that is used to dye fabrics. the machine then lowers the heat and pressure, and the co2 leaves the dye vessels as a gas. in the process, 95% of the co2 is recovered and stored as liquid ready for reuse, which makes dyecoo an almost closed-loop technology. the result is that no processing water or chemicals are required, with a 50% reduction in energy consumption for the process. moreover, the process is substantially quicker than conventional textile dyeing methods. why you should care between 17 and 20% of industrial water pollution is generated by textile dyeing processes, and the industry continues to cause environmental stress on the water resources in developing countries. this co2-based dyeing process offers a sustainable alternative to conventional water-based dyeing process, in which up to 700 liters of freshwater are typically required to finish just one kg of textiles. in addition, dyecoo’s process lowers operational costs by up to 45% compared to conventional textile dying, according to the company.",http://www.dyecoo.com/,SDG 13: Climate Action,,13.6 Engineered Solutions for Carbon Removal,,,,,,,,Netherlands,Unknown,Emerging,Yes,Series A,"6,000,000",N/A,,High income,Netherlands,,2008,13,,,,,,Sustainia,TRUE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,1,0.33,0,0.598,Emerging,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nautical Torque Technology,Clean energy from large particles,Nautical Torque Technology is a clean tech start up company based out of San Francisco California with a workshop in San Rafael CA. Our patented process takes advantage of the energy potential in large particles of slow moving mass (LPSMs) by coupling the vertical force of tidal movement with the weight of the LPSM. Our process utilizes the lifting capacity of water rather than the actual force of the water as in tidal and wave power. Every day LPSMs in the form of ships barges and tankers move up and down with the incoming and outgoing tide. Inventor and founder Cahill Maloney developed the concept over 10 years and has teamed up with various mechanical engineers and designers to construct the initial proofs of concepts and working models.,http://www.nauticaltorquetechnology.com/,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy,,7.2 Energy Sources,,,,,,,,United States of America,Unknown,Emerging,,,,N/A,,High income,USA,,2014,1,,,,,,ImpactSpace,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,0.5,0.66,0,0.596,Emerging,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

essento,bug burgers brought to swiss supermarkets,"essento’s insect-based meat alternatives seek to change the way europeans think about eating bugs, and reduce the environmental footprint of meat-heavy diets. according to the food and agriculture organisation (fao), more than two billion people already consume insects on a regular basis, yet across europe they’re still considered pretty gross. by processing insects into a range of insect burgers and balls, essento hope to bring these nutritious food sources into the european diet. since the swiss government revised their food safety laws in 2017 to permit insect-based foods to be sold, essento has partnered with major supermarket chain coop to bring insects into the spotlight. eating insects can bring major health benefits. they’re full of important vitamins and minerals, like vitamin b12, iron and calcium. they supply a similar amount of protein per weight to fish and other meat sources, as well as essential fatty acids found in avocados, nuts and fatty fish. aside from the health benefits, insect-based meat alternatives have a much lower environmental footprint than conventional animal products. per kilogram of equivalent edible protein, they produce less than 20 kg of co2 equivalent, compared with 120 kg from beef. in addition, they consume far less water and one-tenth of the feed of beef, meaning they place much less strain on the earth’s resources. why you should care the western meat-centred diet is one of the most significant factors in our environmental footprint. it contributes to land degradation and deforestation, diverts food and water away from human consumption and drives up food prices, and causes undue suffering to sentient animals. insects could be an important protein source that demands fewer resources and energy.",https://essento.ch/,SDG 2: Zero Hunger,,2.4 New Protein Sources,,,,,,,,europe,Growth,Nascent,Yes,Undisclosed,Undisclosed,N/A,,High income,Switzerland,,2013,7,,,,X,,Sustainia,TRUE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,0.5,0,0,0.2,Nascent,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Full Circle Filament,We aim to create an ethical 3D printing filament by blending recycled PET sourced responsibly from waste pickers to increase the earnings of waste pickers in Thailand.,"Full Circle Filament (FCF) is working to create high-quality 3D printing filament created with recycled PET (water bottles) material. The 3D printing market is taking off creating an ever growing demand for plastic. However, most 3D printing filament is made of virgin plastic resins, thus increasing the use of nonrenewable resources, and the filaments made from recycled content tend to be of low quality. Our PET will be ethically sourced via partnerships with local waste pickers who are part of the informal recycling system. Through those partnerships, FCF will help raise the incomes of the waste pickers.At the same time, there is a growing demand for high quality recycled filament from conscious consumers. That's where we come in. Full Circle Filament is a start-up that seeks to close the loop in 3D printing.

waveco,underwater turbine generates stable wave power,"waveco has developed technology to harness the power of the waves to generate energy, which can either be used to provide a steady source of power to a grid, or for remote ocean applications. waves contain an enormous amount of renewable energy, referred to as hydrokinetic energy. waveco’s subwave technology seeks to connect users to this energy both for the central energy grid and for off-grid uses. the subwave turbine is suspended around 100 metres below the ocean’s surface, hanging from a floating buoy. as the buoy is raised and lowered by the waves on the surface, the propellers on the subwave turbine rotate, generating an electric current. subwave technology has a number of applications. a number of the turbines can be connected by cables, creating a sort of ‘wave farm’, that can then be connected to a centralised power grid. alternatively, single turbines can be connected directly to their point of use. for instance, the first application of the subwave technology will be the automar, which is a floating observation device used to collect ocean data. the subwave turbine will be connected to the buoy, providing a consistent and clean source of energy. why you should care according to the world energy council, the wave energy could produce around double the amount of total electricity demand in 2008. however, as of yet, commercial applications have been limited.",http://www.waveco.no/index.html,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy,,7.2 Energy Sources,,,,,,,,norway,Prototype,Emerging,,,,N/A,,High income,norway,,2014,90,,,,,,Sustainia,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,0.5,0.66,0.5,0.596,Emerging,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

greenwave,vertical ocean farming creates healthy ecosystems,"greenwave’s vertical ocean farming systems assist ocean farmers in producing healthy and local foods, while capturing carbon and providing biomass to generate biofuel. greenwave has created a system for vertical ocean farming, where seaweed, scallops and mussels grow on floating ropes that are stacked above oyster and clam cages below. the ocean farms are systems of underwater vertical gardens, able to grow 10 to 30 tons of sea vegetables and 250,000 shellfish on each acre per year. using these crops, food, fertilizer, animal feed and biofuels can be produced. according to the company, the kelp produced absorbs five times more carbon than land-based plants, and the crops do not require any fertilizers, freshwater, antibiotics or pesticides. rather than conventional and vulnerable monocultures, this approach creates resilient, biodiverse ecosystems using the entire water column from sea-bed to the surface. for the first time in generations, we have an opportunity to grow food the right way, provide good middle-class jobs, restore ecosystems, and feed the planet. bren smith – founder and executive director, greenwave greenwave has a replicable business model and will partner with anyone who owns a boat and has access to $20,000 for start-up costs to start their own farm. the company currently has 15 farms in development. farming the sea: why eating kelp is good for you and good for the environment from patrick mustain on vimeo . why you should care fisheries contribute significantly to global food security, livelihoods and the economy. overfishing impairs the functioning of ecosystems and reduces biodiversity, with negative repercussions for sustainable social and economic development. designed to restore rather than deplete ocean ecosystems, greenwave’s ocean farms increase biodiversity and restoration in areas where ecosystems are suffering or are completely depleted.",https://www.greenwave.org/,SDG 14: Life Below Water,,14.5 Sustainable Seafood Solutions,,,,,,,,United States of America,Go-to-market,Nascent,No,Unfunded,Not Applicable,N/A,,High income,USA,,2010,24,,,,,,Sustainia,TRUE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,1,0,0.5,0.4,Nascent,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

groasis,growing trees in deserts with minimal water use,"the groasis growboxx plant cocoon allows plants and trees to grow in desert areas using limited water resources, without continuous energy or irrigation demand. the groasis growboxx plant cocoon is a planting technology for eroded, rocky, dry and desert areas that allows growth of a single tree, or a tree in combination with four other plants. it is filled with a one-time dose of 15 liters of water, which is prevented from evaporating by the design of the box. instead, water is slowly released into the soil surrounding the seeds. rain and condensation from the surroundings are also collected in the box. in this way, a heavy rain shower of just 10 minutes once a year can be stored and apportioned to the plant until the following season. if the two billion hectares of man-made deserts were small enough to cut, it is certainly small enough to replant. pieter hoff – founder, groasis the box releases only 50 ml of water per day. with such a limited amount of water, the plants are forced to search deeper into the ground and over time – even in the driest areas – the roots typically find water within just a few feet. once the plants have established a root system, the box biodegrades, encouraging further growth and creating a cradle-to-cradle product. why you should care according to the company, the average survival rate for the trees is over 90%, no matter how challenging the circumstances. likewise, water savings are more than 90% compared to any other planting method during the first year. from the second year onwards, water savings become 100% as no water is artificially added.",https://www.groasis.com/en,SDG 13: Climate Action,,13.6 Engineered Solutions for Carbon Removal,,,,,,,,Netherlands,Go-to-market,Emerging,Yes,Series A,"1,242,615",N/A,,High income,Netherlands,,2003,12,,,,,,Sustainia,TRUE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,https://goexplorer.org/growing-trees-in-deserts-with-minimal-water-use/,1,0.33,0,0.598,Emerging,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bombora wave power,making waves in renewable energy generation,"bombora wave energy has developed a technology for harnessing the consistent energy in waves. the mwave sits on the ocean floor, making it resilient in storms and unobtrusive to other marine activity. the bombora mwave captures energy from waves and converts it into clean electricity. due to the risk of damage from strong storms, wave energy technologies are typically expensive and have a complex design. however, realising that 80% of wave energy can be harnessed from 10m below the ocean’s surface, the mwave lies on the ocean floor. it has three main components: a concrete bed that anchors it to the ocean floor; a series of flexible rubber membranes; and a turbine. the membranes are filled with air, and upon receiving pressure from the waves, the air is driven through the turbine, generating electricity. the air is then recycled back into the membranes, ready for the next wave. a sub-sea cable then transports the electricity to shore where it is distributed into the local power grid. because the device sits on the ocean floor, most other marine activities, including recreational pursuits, can still take place uninterrupted. at present, the company is developing a series of 1.5mw converters in albany, western australia, which are expected to come into operation in 2020. in 2018 they received £10.3 million in funding to build a 1.5mw demonstration project in wales, and are also pursuing further projects including a 60mw wave farm in peniche in portugal, and another in the orkney islands in scotland. why you should care wave energy is a much less mature market than other renewable sources such as wind and solar power, despite the fact it is highly predictable and less volatile than its counterparts. however, with the right technology and investment, the company estimates that wave power has the potential to provide 10% of total global energy needs . bombora wave energy has developed a simple, resilient and scalable solution that will not interfere with other marine activities or wildlife.",http://www.bomborawave.com/,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy,,7.2 Energy Sources,,,,,,,,australia,Unknown,Mature,,,,N/A,,High income,Australia,,,Unknown,,,,,,Sustainia,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,1,0.66,1,0.796,Mature,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ImagineCargo,ImagineCargo is reducing the emissions of logistics,"Our approach is to completely re-design the transportation network for carrying packages so that negative impacts are engineered-out of the process. By providing software solutions, replacing trucks, airplanes and vans with bikes, trikes and train, we can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 99%. We believe we are the first to design a complete international package delivery network with minimised external impacts as a fundamental principle. Combined with per shipment optimisation for CO2 emissions we do everything we can to transport every package with minimum impact, while keeping prices and transit times competitive with customer expectations. We will also display the (specific, per package) CO2 saving on package labels so that everyone who handles the package is made aware of the reduced impact. We are working on the following to revolutionize how logistics is done: *Operative Logistics* We've developed an operating concept for city logistics services using high-capacity cargo bikes/trikes to replace significant numbers of delivery trucks in congested city centres contributing large reductions in CO2, particulate, NOx, noise, accidents and other external impacts connected with trucks. With years of experience in the logistics sector we operate a sustainable logsitics network in Germany, Switzerland and Austria and are currently working on expanding it throughout Europe. We go as far as offering solutions for *Software Development* We're currently developing software that will enable us and our network to automatically dispatch shipments to be transported as efficiently as possible, both ecologically and economically. Alongside GPS-data and nodes, CO2-emssion and working conditions will be measured and displayed in the software to give a more detailed track&trace than what we're used to from other integrators. Our ultimate goal is to be able to provide our own operation as well as our network with a full-fledged software package giving us the competitive edge over conventional providers. *Engineering* For our own fleets as well as for our network we're working on a Predictive Maintenance solution for professional sustainable logistics vehicles. To be able to operate large fleets of relatively light vehicles it is essential to have a working maintenance and service plan. To be able to predict defects and service intervals we're working on a cost effective sensor array backed by an AI.

Just Vertical,Unleashing urban farmers,"At Just Vertical we make the planet and you healthier while minimizing your environmental footprint. We unleash your inner farmer with our easy to use produce growing system. Take the guess work out of gardening and turn any living room, kitchen, office, or closet into your mini-farm. Just Vertical is a hydroponics rental and sales company with an innovative business model and technology. We are committed to our goal of eliminating 8 billion food miles before the 8 billionth person is born. Our business model is based around overcoming the barriers that urbanites have engaging with hydroponic farming, namely cost, capabilities, and physical space. We meet all these challenges through our reoccurring revenue model of renting systems out instead of selling them while packaging them with our seedlings to overcome capabilities gaps. Our technology itself is sleek, aesthetic, and takes up less square footage while remaining incredibly productive. Under the current iteration of our system we have managed to grow produce faster than in field conditions while using significantly less inputs. Our system is 95-99% more water efficient than traditional systems while using no pesticides. Our vision for Just Vertical is based around doing well by doing good. We are also pioneering hydroponic plant research into hops, quinoa, and arctic growing. We have prioritized our ability to continue to drive research and development even in the hectic world of start-ups. Additionally, we strongly believe in the potential of our technology and our company to make the world a better place through reducing others sustainability footprints. The next big step we want to take with IKEA is bringing the cost down to bring our healthy and environmentally positive growing to as many people as possible. Right now we have absolutely nailed the plant science and are pioneers in that field. However, the hardware we use to grow the plants in is currently too expensive to be accessible to anything more than the wealthy. We need to change this and IKEA is the perfect partner to do this with. Currently we can produce plants for as little as half a cent ($0.005). This enables us to provide healthy, nutritious food to customers at a fraction of the cost of traditional grocery stores. Now we need to perfect the home growing system in order to truly enable everybody on the planet to be able to grow their own healthy, environmentally friendly, produce.",http://www.justvertical.com,SDG 2: Zero Hunger,,2.1 AgTech for Sustainable Farming,,,,,,,,Canada,Go-to-market,Nascent,Yes,Seed,Undisclosed,N/A,,High income,Canada,,2017,10,,,,,,IKEA Bootcamp,TRUE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,0.5,0,0,0.2,Nascent,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

land life company,biodegradable tree incubators for mass reforestation,"the cocoon is a biodegradable tree incubator, designed to provide seedlings with shelter and water and give them a higher chance of survival in degraded ecosystems. the cocoon is a donut-shaped pot that is designed to protect seedlings during their first year of growth – the time when they are most vulnerable. the cocoon is made from recycled paper pulp, and is completely biodegradable. the seedling sits in the centre of the pot in a protective shelter, making it less exposed to animals and harsh weather conditions. the pot around the seedling holds 25 litres of water, and wicking technology slowly transports the water from the outer container into the protective shelter. this provides a stable source of water for the seedling during early growth when the seedling is establishing root structures to find groundwater. this is particularly critical in areas where there is little rainfall, as without secure water access, plants often die before they are able to develop roots deep enough to discover water beneath the surface. land life have already commenced projects in over 25 countries. for instance, in australia they partnered with the university of new south wales to reforest a former mine site. australia’s gold rush, which took place during the 1850s, left an unfortunate legacy of over 50,000 unrestored mine sites. the two organisations planted two types of native australian trees – eucalyptus and casuarina trees – in the former mine site using the cocoon technology. despite harsh weather conditions and dry soils, 90% of the seedlings have survived. why you should care at present, there are over two billion hectares of land on earth that have suffered from degradation. reforesting arid areas is challenging due to harsh conditions, dry soils and inconsistent rainfall. conventional reforestation techniques in these areas may rely on irrigation, which can be expensive and water intensive. reforestation can bring numerous benefits to the environment and to people. it can protect the watershed, prevent erosion and landslides, and act as a natural carbon sink. in addition, forests can provide livelihoods, shelter, food and medicine for rural communities.",https://www.landlifecompany.com/,SDG 13: Climate Action,,13.6 Engineered Solutions for Carbon Removal,,,,,,,,Netherlands,Unknown,Nascent,Yes,Series A,"8,921,036",3-10M,,High income,Netherlands,,2013,35,,,,,,Sustainia,TRUE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,0.5,0.33,0.5,0.398,Nascent,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lokalist,Lokalist is developing a machine learning platform that can determine the value of an item on your local secondhand market. - Why: It is difficult to determine how much an item should cost on the secondhand market; causing many people to lose money when they go to sell stuff they do not use anymore. This problem is further exaggerated for people who buy and sell secondhand items professionally. - - What is our solution: We are developing an AI that can determine the value of an item on your local secondhand market by automatically aggregating and cleaning public pricing data from local secondhand markets. This allows us to give a more accurate picture of a specific items ideal price; demand; and potential margins. With this information; we can begin revealing this data through a simple interface to help our users make smarter decisions and avoid the costs of lost revenues. - - What are the 3 main challenges we face to make this a success? - 1. Price is currently very individualistic Since price is currently so vague and a lot of it has to deal with emotions as well as data; it will be interesting to see how we can develop ways to overcome the inherent differences we all possess on how much something is worth. I do believe there are ways to provide individual pricing to different people much like the airline industry is able to offer different flight prices to different people but it is a much larger challenge that would come at a later stage. - - 2. Purchasing items will cost money Our plan to initially buy and sell items for profit to support our development will require an initial capital investment. We have raised some money; and my background is in the space where I had a proven history of accurately and effectively profiting from items I was trying to sell; but it requires that I have to focus time; energy; and money on this part of the business to ensure its success. - - 3. Current 3rd party data is very unstructured Developing a way of automating the price discovery of an item is quite difficult due to the very nature of the way people upload items for sale. Often times they leave out key details; ask people to make an offer; or list a price that is not the actual price they would accept and these variables could affect the outcome of the price our AI determines to be correct. Developing ways to automate clean up; and account for these inaccuracies automatically will be a major focus as we develop features to automate our product further. - - What we need to get there - We are currently looking to raise capital; ideally from a syndicated round of smart money angels. Our goal will be to develop our story and product to deliver upon what I call our Minimum Viable Story or “MVS” below: - - We are out to automatically determine the value of any item on your local secondhand market; currently we have developed a way to accurately determine the value of any smartphone; and we are using this ability to support our team as we develop and expand to other categories of items where we feel we have the ability to do the same thing. We are seeking partners and investors that could help us speed up our ability to accomplish this task. - - Using this MVS we plan to land an investment within the next 18 months by convincing investors of our ability to accurately determine the value of a smartphone and laying out the path to expand to other categories; all the while laying out the potential value of this solution to our target customers over the next 3-5 years,,https://www.lokalist.dk/,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production,,Product System,,,,Household,,Big Data Machine Learning,B2C,Developed Markets,End of life,Nascent,Yes,Seed,"109,990",,,,Denmark,,2017,6,,,,X,,,TRUE,FALSE,,TRUE,FALSE,,0.5,0,0,0.2,Nascent,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

miljøskærm,noise barriers made from upcycled wind turbines,"the danish company miljøskærm has come up with a creative use for retired wind turbine blades – they recycle the fibreglass into sound barriers for busy roads in order to address noise pollution. wind turbines are typically made from fibreglass, due to its light weight and durability, but this composite material is usually landfilled because it is notoriously complex to recycle. miljøskærm collects the used blades and shreds the fibreglass material into small fibres. these fibres are then pressed together into sheets that are designed to be highly porous and therefore effective at absorbing noise. manufacturing noise barriers using recycled fibre glass also requires 40% less energy and generates 60% less overall co2 emissions than conventional products made from aluminium and mineral wool. the material has been trialled for noise pollution control in the copenhagen suburb of vallensbæk. the suburb has experienced significant growth in traffic in recent years, and now over 100,000 cars pass through each day. a miljøskærm sound barrier was installed in june 2016, and effectively brought noise pollution from 61 decibels to 54, bringing it well below the acceptable level of 58 decibels. why you should care miljøskærm is simultaneously addressing two issues. first, on a global scale it is expected that discarded wind turbine waste will exceed 150,000 tonnes annually by 2027 . finding a new purpose for this material is important for avoiding wasteful landfilling. second, the social and environmental consequences of excessive noise exposure in europe is estimated to cost €40 billion per year. noise pollution has been linked to sleep deprivation, stress, high blood pressure and more.",http://miljoskarm.dk/english/,SDG 9: Industry Innovation and Infrastructure,,9.2 Advanced technologies for sustainable industry,,,,,,,,Denmark,Unknown,Nascent,No,Unfunded,Not Applicable,N/A,,High income,Denmark,,2011,Unknown,,,,,,Sustainia,TRUE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,0.5,0,1,0.2,Nascent,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Movildrive,"Movilidad Eléctrica Conectada para trabajadores de PYMES, Autónomos y usuarios Particulares","MovilDrive es una empresa creada en Marzo de 2018 para el desarrollo de software de aplicaciones de móvil en los sectores tecnológicos más disruptivos de hoy en día como ""Connected-Car"", ""Smart-City"" y ""ADAS"" ADAS proviene de Autonomous Driving Assistance Systems, y es el sector en el que se ha formado el socio fundador CEO de MovilDrive, Alberto Lebrón durante los últimos años en Alemania. El objetivo fundamental es el de crear innovación a través del desarrollo Software. Por eso, hemos detectado varios problemas de hoy en día en el centro de Madrid (y en otras grandes ciudades) y hemos comenzado a desarrollar una primera solución para ayudar a resolver este reto. En el sitio web: https://movildrive.com/soluciones.html planteamos nuestra primera solución básica para PYMES y Autónomos para Android / iOS. Se trata de un Car-Sharing eléctrico con vehículos grandes para trabajadores de PYMES y Autónomos y tambíen para particulares. El modelo de negocio está basado en un Car-Sharing, muy extendido en los últimos años, que se podría segmentar entre particulares y empresas. El mercado está validado por diversos estudios y conocidas firmas de consultoría y muestra oportunidad de negocio hasta 2030 debido a las nuevas leyes sobre contaminación CO2 y las normativas europeas para fabricar vehículos eléctricos de todas las marcas :) Aún no existe una solución de Van-Sharing para pequeños empresarios y autónomos que tienen que hacer sus repartos o realizar sus servicios cada diario en el centro de Madrid y Barcelona, y esto les crea un problema a la hora de moverse, encontrar aparcamiento y acceso al centro. Además de las multas que estos pequeños empresarios tienen que ""pagar por trabajar"" que hace que las performance de sus negocios y sus ganancias se vean afectadas, repercutiendo directamente al bolsillo de los responsables del negocio a final de mes. Por eso planteamos esta primera solución, para ayudar a los trabajadores de todos los sectores PYMES, y donde cubriremos usuarios profesionales, autónomos y usuarios particulares que podrán usar nuestras furgonetas eléctricas por la ciudad a diaria y los fines de semana. Una de las ventajas competitivas que ofrecemos respecto a otras empresas es la posibilidad de desarrollar una App con Inteligencia Artificial y Deep-Learning para detectar objetos urbanos y envíar notificaciones al usuario y al coche a través de alertas en su Smart-Phone. (Sector Connected-Car y Smart-City) Otro posible uso sería para aseguradores donde podríamos guardar datos de conducción del usuario (de la flota o empresa) identificando situaciones de distracción al volante y conducciones irregulares para avisar al conductor a través de alertas e indicar medidas más seguras al volante. La primera App básica ya está en Google Play y ha sido desarrollada por el fundador junto con dos becarios de programación, y en un tiempo record hemos integrado una solución completa de car-sharing, con monitoreo y tracking de vehículos en Tiempo Real. El primer vehículo Movildrive también está ya disponible y tiene más de 10 usuario en menos de 1 mes: https://movildrive.com/comofunciona.html En adelante queremos ampliar nuestro equipo para traer con nosotros a desarrolladores de Java y de iOS que tengan experiencia en Machine Learning, además de un técnico de Márketing y SEO para llevar a cabo nuestras primeras campañas de márketing online y publicidad. Aunque nuestro primer Movildrive es una Berlingo Eléctrica, dejaremos al inversor que elija el modelo de furgón eléctrico en el que quiere invertir (Nissan NV200, Peugeot Partner Eléctrica, Kangoo ZE, etc) Nuestro Pitch-Deck para el primer MVP en fase Seed cuenta únicamente con los gastos de estos desarrolladores que se incorporen para ayudar al desarrollo de las App más avanzadas, y la primera flota de 10 vehículos. Las primeras figuras KPI de Julio 2018 aseguran la rentabilidad del negocio, y aunque aún es muy pronto para hacer un analisis finaciero, establece un retorno de la inversión mínimo del 50% sin haber hecho ninguna campaña de marketing ni de publicidad en estos momentos. Al Break-Even o Punto de Equilibrio se llegaría en menos de tres años, ofreciendo rentabilidad a partir del primer día, y desde ese momento solo ganancia, con vehículos eléctricos con poco mantenimiento y tan solo un recambio de las baterías entre los 5-7 años. El Plan de Negocio ha sido realizado para un equipo de 5px y con flotas de 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 y 300+ vehículos eléctricos y se han analizado todos los escenarios posibles con cifras reales. Nuestra estrategia en este momento, es ir paso a paso, comprobando que el negocio es escalable, y pasar de una flota pequeña a otras mayores en función del retorno de la inversión y de la respuesta de nuestros usuarios.",https://movildrive.com/,SDG 13: Climate Action,,13.4 Decarbonised Transport,,,,,,,,"paris, milano, londres, marsella, madrid, roma, bruselas, copenhague, barcelona",Unknown,Nascent,No,Unfunded,Not Applicable,N/A,,High income,Spain,,2018,4,,,,,,StartupXplore,TRUE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,0.5,0,0,0.2,Nascent,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MyMedCards,MyMedCards startede efter at grundlæggeren; Sarah Bach Munkholm; i 2013 opdagede hvor svært tilgængelige korte “her-og-nu” informationer såsom lommekort; actioncards; kittelkort og sundhedsfaglige instrukser mv. var. Alle sundhedsfaglig personale gik med disse informationskort i lommerne; men ingen vidst hvordan man kunne få kittekortene; lommekortene eller actioncards’ene eller hvordan disse blev opdateret og vedligeholdt. - - Desuden var der en specifik episode; som fik Sarah til endelig at påbegynde udviklingen af app’en og dermed virksomheden. Hun var med i skadestuen; hvor en yngre læge fik en akut patient. Her ledte hun efter sit actioncards; kittelkort og lommekort som var lamineret og uddelt til hende i forbindelse med hende Klinisk Basis Uddannelse (KBU) i Region Nordjylland. Men den dag havde hun glemt hendes actioncards; kittelkort; lommekort og de andre sundhedsfaglige instrukser; og hun blev nervøs; for det var jo disse lommekort; som hun jo så godt kendte fra sin uddannelse og derfor vidst hvordan man skulle agere ud fra. Derfor spurgte hun bl.a. Sarah; som stod som medicinstuderende på 6. semester; om hun havde det pågældende kittelkort; som hun måtte låne. Men det havde hun ikke; for hun havde jo ikke været i KBU endnu og havde derfor ikke den samme adgang til disse tilsyneladende gode og anvendelige kittelkort; lommekort og actioncards. - - Det endte så med at den yngre læge forlod patienten; for at finde en anden KBU læge; som også havde kittelkortene; hvorefter hun kunne færdiggøre sin behandling af den akutte patient. - - Sådan kom ideen til MyMedCards.,,http://www.mymedcards.dk,SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being,,,,,,Health & Wellbeing,Telehealth; Better disease management; Electronic medical records,Lean Service Models,B2B,Developed Markets,,Nascent,Yes,Undisclosed,Undisclosed,,,,Denmark,,2016,4,,,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,0.5,0,0,0.2,Nascent,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sustainer homes,rethinking construction with modular wooden homes,"sustainer homes designs and constructs unique buildings through innovative sustainable design principles and a focus on renewable energy. their buildings are modular, customisable and self-contained to suit a variety of needs, including residential and commercial property. seeking to reduce the environmental impact of the construction industry, sustainer homes has developed a modular system for constructing customisable homes and office buildings. the company uses finnish pine wood as the key material in the building modules, due to its low environmental footprint, versatility and durability. buildings can either be selected from a catalogue of designs or custom-designed using a combination of the company’s different models. each piece of the building is carved out using high precision techniques involving computer-controlled saws. further, each piece has a unique identification code, which speeds up the construction process and means that individual parts can be easily replicated and replaced in case of damage. once the components of the house are cut, they are assembled in a warehouse, meaning there is no delay or damage due to adverse weather conditions (an important consideration in the netherlands). afterwards, the finished pieces are transported to the site, where they are installed in one to two days. energy is a key consideration in their design. each building is fitted with solar panels to provide energy for electricity and heating, and are properly insulated to maximise the energy efficiency of heating and cooling systems. thanks to the integration of renewable energy systems and smart use of materials, sustainer homes estimates that their buildings generate 90% less co₂ emissions than conventionally built properties made from steel and concrete. at present they are only operating in the netherlands, as their buildings are designed to comply with dutch regulatory standards. in the future they intend to extend their services beyond homes and offices, to hotels and even emergency accommodation in off-grid areas. why you should care the way buildings are constructed and used has an enormous impact on resource consumption. construction and demolition in the eu is responsible for between 25-30% of all solid waste created . in addition, buildings consume 40% of energy in the eu and generate 36% of greenhouse gas emissions . therefore, constructing low waste, energy efficient buildings can be an important tool for reducing the construction sector’s environmental footprint in the eu.",https://www.sustainerhomes.nl/,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,,13.5 Decarbonised Buildings,,,,,,,,Netherlands,Unknown,Nascent,Yes,Seed,"687,527",N/A,,High income,Netherlands,,2015,26,,,,X,,Sustainia,TRUE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,0.5,0,0.5,0.2,Nascent,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early diagnosis and follow-up treatments is necessary to prevent eye diseases from turning into blindness. - Early diagnosis is limited by the ability to make 3D OCT images of the eye. OCT is a non-invasive imaging technique used extensively by eye specialists to obtain cross-sectional images of the eye for diagnosis and treatment. Today; it is only possible to make partial 3D OCT images of the eye as the eye constantly moves. The current technology is not fast enough to take a full image of the eye within those small movements.

PermeaPod,We Save Water,"PermeaPod is a tank made of microporous ceramic, which connects to an existing irrigation system, and is buried next to the roots of the plant or tree. Soil absorbs water until it reaches field capacity. Roots in contact or proximity with the tank, dry the soil, thus leeching water out of the block by capillary force. 40-60% Water savings: savings in deposits and infrastructures for the farmer and for irrigation groups (State-Region). Savings avoiding deep infiltration, savings avoiding evaporation, the plant only takes by capillarity what it needs. Close to 100% efficiency. 40-50% Fertilizer saving: the fertilizer is dissolved in the irrigation water. 20-40% Phytosanitary saving: No water-logging is generated in the soil, so this prevents the germination of weeds and the proliferation of pests and diseases. 20-40% Saves energy by reducing the volume of water to be pumped, transported. Labor saving, the reduction of wetness in soil avoids the proliferation of weeds that need not be removed, it also reduces costs of eliminating such waste. Reducing fertilizer use improves the saturation of nitrates in the sea and aquifers. It does not need high pressure so the energy bill is reduced in some cases. Reducing water use: reduces salinization of soil and aquifers by marine intrusion. Less humidity is generated in greenhouses so there are fewer fungal infections and less condensation. Reduction of phytosanitary treatments. The plant only takes the water it needs and when it needs it. Irregular irrigation errors are avoided for both excess and defect and therefore, situations caused by these errors are avoided, such as root asphyxia or water stress.

Reforestum,Carbon offsetting through collective reforestation,"Reforestum aims to be the definitive tool that empowers people to take climate action, to take responsibility on their daily actions, to live in a more sustainable way, and finally, to create a better world by building a community of Change Makers that aim to Reforest the world and protect existing forests. Politicians and corporations are a heavy and slow machinery. The latest driven only by profit. People know this, and they are tired of waiting for solutions, people want to participate and take action. But they are also busy and often too worried about their own issues as per investing their time on planting a tree or riding a bicycle instead of driving their car. Fortunately nowadays technology is accesible for everyone. There are specialized Apps that helps us in every task we can imagine. We look at the weather forecast, consult the stock markets, book hotels, reserve taxis, present boarding passes at the airport, read digital newspapers and will end up connecting online with our doctor. Our smartphone is often the last thing we see before felling asleep and we use it as our clock alarm in the morning. However, how many of us is using its smartphone or tablet to create a better world? Which APP is out there that allows you to become an environmental hero? What is the Company that allows you to plant a forest, to become carbon neutral, to measure your impact in the environment, that reinforces you when you do something positive, that brings you environmental awareness, that even makes your ego grow when you share your heroic acts on social media, that encourages you to actually do it all, but even better: DOES IT FOR YOU! Well, Reforestum is all of it and much more. Reforestum offers a green hub for each individual and company that cares about the planet and the future of humanity, that is aware of the risk we are taking if we don’t come all together against climate change. We offer reforestation and offsetsing services globaly. In a few months we count with 1049 clients from 53 countries and 5 continents. Each time anyone makes use of a taxi ride, a Uber, a flight, a hotel, a car sharing service, electricity, vacations, clothes, document shipping, online shopping… it´s all digital, and we want to connect and funnel it all towards our APP. Let´s talk about an ideal scenario: You take a taxi from Schuman to Zaventen Airport, at the end of your trip the App provides you with a exact calculation: the vehicle has polluted 0,5 Kg of CO2 and then offers you to offset your carbon footprint for a few cents of Euro. If you agree the App will extend the forest that you already own in the north of Belgium in a small fraction. Imagine now that you do the same thing many times during the year, and that at the end of that year the outcome is that you owe rights over 200 sqm of forest, a forest that you can actually visit, that you can track online through the Reforestum App! It´s like a savings box for your grandchildren! And not only that, Reforestum is building an online communty of earth warriors with competitions, badges and more. The App will analyze your lifestlyle and give you advice in order to reduce your ecological footprint. It will congratulate you each time you are closer to neutrality maybe because you walked instead of taking a taxi, or said no to a plastic bag. Of course, the objective is that each one of us can become carbon neutral and that we can all together reforest the world! We are already in business, we have planted a first forest in Spain and have delivered a first version of the online APP. Unexpectedly, some companies came to us in order to offset their emissions, so we are developing a B2B strategy that is already working successfully.

regen network,ecological blockchain for agricultural regeneration,"regen network is a global community and platform focused on ecological monitoring and regeneration. the company aims to catalyse the regeneration of ecosystems. using a combination of monitoring technologies such as satellites and ground sensors, regen network aims to provide a global picture of ecosystem health, and provide incentives for regeneration across the many degraded landscapes. 37% of the earth’s surface is used for agriculture in some way, so the company has chosen to focus on farmers as change makers for the system. users are able to input ecological data to an immutable blockchain system, then choose to share or sell that data with other network users. smart contracts can then be used to pay farmers for regenerative practices, according to a number of ecological protocols developed collaboratively by network users and scientists. regenerative land management practices can lead to dramatic increases in biodiversity, water retention, and carbon sequestration. for example, tilling is an agricultural practice that contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and the loss of soil nutrients. it is also something that can be monitored by open-source satellite technology. farmers choosing not to till their fields can be verified by the satellite technology and rewarded for contributing to a more sustainable and regenerative agricultural industry. other examples of good practice that can be tracked and incentivised relatively easily include: urban tree planting, agroforestry practices, and collections of ocean plastic waste. why you should care agriculture is the second largest global producer of greenhouse gas emissions. it is also vital for supporting human life, and without a movement to more regenerative practices, we could begin to see a decline in yields and output. regenerative agriculture builds healthy soil that can sequester atmospheric carbon, making it the 11th-ranking solution for climate change stabilisation by 2050.",https://www.regen.network/,SDG 2: Zero Hunger,,2.1 AgTech for Sustainable Farming,,,,,,,,United States of America,Unknown,Emerging,,,,N/A,,High income,USA,,2017,16,,,,,,Sustainia,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,0.5,0.66,0.5,0.596,Emerging,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

regrained,crafting new uses for brewery byproducts,"supergrain+ is a flour made from the ‘spent grain’, a byproduct of brewing beers. this fibre and protein rich flour is converted into nutritious snack bars wrapped in biodegradable packaging. regrained was founded by two friends with a hobby for home brewing beer. upon realising the vast amount of grain that is wasted in the brewing process, referred to as ‘spent grain’, they set out to develop a way to create value from this nutritious byproduct. the result is supergrain+, an alternative to flour that is produced using spent grain from local craft breweries around san francisco. in the brewing process, grains such as barley, wheat and rye are mixed with hot water to extract most of their sugars and create alcohol. without these starches, the remaining byproduct is packed with insoluble fibre, protein and micronutrients. in fact, supergrain+ contains 20g of protein and 27g of fibre per 100g, compared to 12g and 3g respectively in plain white flour. it is also a good source of prebiotics, the nutrients that feed probiotics in the gut and promote digestive health. supergrain+ is currently sold in the form of flavoured snack bars, but regrained is experimenting with other products such as chips and bread. to date, they’ve upcycled over 20,000kg of grain. regrained has partnered with packaging industry experts to develop a wrapper that is biodegradable and compostable, in keeping with their no-waste philosophy. their solution is part of a growing trend of what the founders call ‘edible upcycling’, whereby the byproducts from food production are transformed into new food products. they are a certified b-corp organisation, meaning they have been independently verified as an environmentally and socially responsible company. in addition, they are a member of the 1% for the planet movement and donate 1% of their profits to non-profit organisations. why you should care traditionally, spent grain has been collected by farmers and fed to livestock. however the growth of urban craft breweries means that this valuable byproduct is not conveniently available to farmers, meaning it is disposed of using municipal waste services. regrained has discovered a use to recover further value from this nutritious byproduct and cut food waste.",https://www.regrained.com/,SDG 2: Zero Hunger,,2.6 Other,,,,,,,,United States of America,Unknown,Emerging,,,,N/A,,High income,USA,,2017,25,,,,,,Sustainia,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,0.5,0.66,0.5,0.596,Emerging,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ripple foods,give peas a chance: sustainable dairy alternatives,"ripple’s milk products, made from yellow split peas, have a lower environmental impact and more health benefits than dairy and other non-dairy alternatives. ripple has developed a non-dairy milk made from yellow split peas. the peas they use are grown in areas with heavy rainfall, reducing the need for irrigation, and are non-gmo certified. in addition, their packaging is made from 100% recycled materials, and are also recyclable after use. although there are other dairy alternatives available on the market that address some of the environmental and ethical concerns associated with cow milk, many of them have their own drawbacks too. nut milks for example have a huge water footprint, there are concerns over the use of gmos often found in soy milks, and oat milks typically contain high sugar levels. ripple have tried to account for these challenges. their pea milk has one hundredth of the water footprint of almond milk. what’s more, and produces one fifth of the co2 emissions. compared with other milks, pea milk also has less sugar, less saturated fat, more protein, and more vitamins like calcium and vitamin d. why you should care the dairy industry is responsible for approximately 4% of the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions, much of which is methane and nitrous oxide, whose climate impact is more than 100 times that of co2. dairy alternatives like pea milk require fewer inputs and produce less greenhouse gas emissions.",https://www.ripplefoods.com/,SDG 2: Zero Hunger,,2.4 New Protein Sources,,,,,,,,United States of America,Unknown,Emerging,,,,N/A,,High income,USA,,2017,72,,,,,,Sustainia,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,0.5,0.66,0.5,0.596,Emerging,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sense Grass,Digitalizing Agriculture,"Agriculture was the strongest pillar of Indian economy. But over the years, the contribution of Agriculture in GDP has considerably fallen. There are hundreds of problem with Indian Agriculture which include Lack of Technology, Lack of mechanization but the major problem but the major problem lack of effective measures on Pest Control. Approximately 10% of the Foodgrains, 15% of the Pulse crops and 30% of the fruits are lost to pests, Currently, farmers use pesticides to kill these pests but over spray those resources which lead to extra cost of Pesticides, loss of fertility of Soil and problems to humans due to huge amounts of chemical being added. Our mission is to cut input costs of the Indian farmer by helping farmers monitor pests, diseases, and weeds. Sense Grass is a precision agriculture platform for pest control. We will offer CLIMATO, a mobile application and a geo-based big-data engine that reduces the usage of pesticides based on actionable information. We will provide a decision support technology offering farmers a relatively simple data aggregation and pest management tool. Its application enables to monitor pests, diseases, and weeds; view areas affected by pests and weeds, find blind areas and routes, and control scouting; and monitor the effectiveness of sprayings over pest population, and control tank mixture, as well as maintain track/record date, time, site, crop protectants used, and climate conditions. The company’s software application enables technicians to record their activities in the field, as well as interprets and then displays the data in the report and on the maps. It serves co-operatives and dealers, consultants, and farmers. This platform creates value by taking the information collected by scouts on the field to be evaluated by crop consultants and acted upon by growers. Our mobile application allows growers to track information related to crop conditions such as pests, diseases, and weeds. We decided to launch this product because we are engaged in a mission to make agriculture more efficient, profitable and more sustainable. My grandfather was a wheat grower in the north India, and I grew up watching his ups and downs in agriculture. When he passed away, I made a promise to myself: someday, somehow, I am going to help farmers all over the world to be more efficient and profitable.

snact,a delicious protest against food waste,"snact has developed a range of fruit-based snacks made from produce that would otherwise have been wasted, helping to reduce food waste and provide healthy snack options. snact rescues produce that fails to meet cosmetic standards and turns it into healthy snack bars. these products have a longer shelf-life than fresh fruit, reducing the volumes of food waste. their first product was fruit jerky, a dried fruit snack made with 100% fruit and nothing else. they’ve since launched banana bars made with some of the 1.4 million bananas that go to waste in the uk every day. in britain where the company is based, supermarkets are the main customer for farmers, and impose strict guidelines on what constitutes acceptable fruit. if a banana is too wonky, an apple too blemished, or a carrot too kinky, the supermarkets reject the produce and the fruit goes to waste, despite no issues with taste or nutritional value. the company has also developed packaging for their snack bars that will biodegrade in six months, taking inspiration from nature’s own packing – the banana skin – and helping to ensure their product does not have a negative environmental consequence after consumption. why you should care around 1.4 million bananas alone are wasted in the uk every day. snact focuses between the farmers or wholesalers and the supermarkets, to produce ‘less waste, more taste’.",https://snact.co.uk/,SDG 2: Zero Hunger,,2.6 Other,,,,,,,,global,Growth,Nascent,Yes,Seed,Undisclosed,N/A,,High income,United Kingdom,,2013,2,,,,,,Sustainia,TRUE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,0.5,0,0,0.2,Nascent,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sofi filtration,advanced filtration system enhances industrial water recycling,"sofi filtration has developed a low energy, automated water filter for treating industrial wastewater that requires no chemicals or disposable filters. the sofi filter is a fully-automated micro-filtration system for removing solid particles from industrial wastewater streams. sofi filters allow companies with large water requirements such as in the mining, construction or heat and power industries to treat and reuse their wastewater. this ultimately reduces the costs for these companies and the risks of contamination from wastewater streams. the sofi filter is self cleaning, which contributes to longevity, lowers maintenance demands and enhances filtering efficiency. in addition, the filters use no chemicals, and do not require any disposable filtering system alternatives such as cartridges or bags. sofi filters consume relatively low levels of energy, requiring 0.05 kwh/m³ of water that is treated. due to its modular design, the device is easily scalable, ranging in capacity form 0.5 to 280 m³/hr. at present, they are targeting firms in developed countries where governments may have introduced tariffs to create an economic incentive to reduce industrial wastewater discharge. for instance, in finland, companies pay around €3/m³ of water – including the cost of the water and the wastewater discharge cost. sofi filtration allows these firms to filter and reuse their wastewater for around 10% of that cost, meaning that the total volume of water they consume is much smaller. as a result of these cost savings, the payback period on the technology is short. why you should care in europe, heavy industry and energy production account for 40% of total water consumption , which increases competition for other uses such as agriculture and sanitation. technologies like the sofi filter can assist in increasing the proportion of wastewater that is recycled and reused, and help to alleviate the strain on water supply.",http://www.sofifiltration.com/sofi,SDG 9: Industry Innovation and Infrastructure,,9.2 Advanced technologies for sustainable industry,,,,,,,,europe,Unknown,Nascent,Yes,Series A,"55,453",N/A,,High income,Finland,,2011,15,,,,X,,Sustainia,TRUE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,0.5,0.33,0.5,0.398,Nascent,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kitemill,Develops technology that will produce renewable energy in a safe and low-cost manner,"kitemill has developed a technology that harnesses airborne wind energy at high altitudes using a kite. airborne wind energy is a renewable energy technology whereby a kite, attached to the ground by a tether, is moved by winds at a high altitude. unlike conventional wind turbines, which are usually around 100 metres tall, airborne wind energy technologies can reach an altitude of between 500 to 1500 metres, where winds are both stronger and more consistent. kitemill’s airborne wind energy technology consists of a kite that is similar in design and shape to a commercial aeroplane, meaning it is built to withstand rough conditions at high altitudes. the kite is attached to a ground station by a thin tether. as the kite is carried by the wind, energy is generated as the tether is pulled, transferring the energy from the kite to the power generator in the ground station. the kite is fitted with an intelligent control system which uses multiple sensors to ensure that the kite flies at an altitude where energy production conditions are optimal. the company have produced a prototype and estimate that due to lower costs than offshore wind turbines, their technology can offer lower levelised cost of energy compared to current onshore and offshore wind, once they scale up operations. it also allows landlocked countries to access wind energy in their decarbonisation efforts. why you should care wind power has experienced remarkable growth in recent years, now accounting for more than 11% of electricity demand in the eu and 4% of the world in total . however, constructing wind turbines is resource intensive and expensive to install and maintain. awe technology uses approximately 90% fewer resources per watt to construct than conventional wind turbines.",http://www.kitemill.no,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy,,n/a,,,Direct,energy,,,,,,Nascent,Yes,Seed,"800,000",,Mar/2017,,Norway,,2008,10,,,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,1,0,0,0.4,Nascent,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Ocean Cleanup,autonomous floating systems collect ocean waste,"a 600m-long floating system with a tapered 3-meter-deep skirt has been launched into the pacific ocean to passively collect ocean waste as it is propelled naturally around the great pacific garbage patch. since 2013 dutch inventor boyan slat has dreamed about cleaning up the vast quantities of plastic waste that have accumulated in the ocean. earlier this year, with the help of maersk, his 600-meter long plastic catching device was towed from california, to make a dent in the great pacific garbage patch (gpgp) that is wreaking havoc with marine biological systems. the gpgp is the largest accumulation of ocean plastic in the world at around 1.6 million square kilometres and is located between hawaii and california. it is designed with flexibility, scalability and passivity in mind. it follows the natural wind and ocean current flows, exactly as floating plastic would, to reach the same areas where plastic waste congregates in the oceans. the float sits higher in the water than much of the plastic waste, meaning that it is blown faster than the waste can travel, thus collecting waste as it moves through the water. the skirt that sits beneath the float was designed to collect plastic while allowing marine life to pass underneath, creating minimal disturbance. the skirt is also tapered in such a way to create a natural u-shape for the system so that the waste is collected in one place and can be systematically removed by the garbage trucks of the ocean. why you should care ocean debris has been building up at an alarming rate, but the distant nature of the problem means that people are less likely to perceive it as a pressing problem. that is not however the case for marine life. the ocean cleanup’s long-term ambition is to install at least 60 systems, with the aim of removing half of the 80,000 tonnes of plastic in the great pacific garbage patch within five years.",https://www.theoceancleanup.com/?gclid=eaiaiqobchmi_9okkygz3qivjcqych39lgw_eaayasaaegipv_d_bwe,SDG 14: Life Below Water,,14.1 Marine Cleanup Technologies,,,,,,,,Netherlands,Growth,Emerging,Yes,Series C,"35,400,000",N/A,,High income,Netherlands,,2012,147,,,,,X,Sustainia,TRUE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,0.5,0.66,1,0.596,Emerging,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Solelia Greentech,Solar power is sustainable - Solar electricity can be produced locally; reducing distribution losses and relieving the load on the power grid; besides being a renewable energy source. - Charging points connected to Solarcharge Systems will be provided with a Solarcharge Certificate that verifies the use of solar energy and gives a strong environmental profile. - - The need for electric vehicle charging points increases rapidly. It will be a challenge for both individual property owners and society in general. The risk is obvious that the power grid; both locally and nationally will be exposed to high loads. This leads to an increased need for investment in new electricity power supply and other infrastructure measures. - - - At the same time an increasing number of electric vehicles charged via the electricity grid will lead to a growing battery capacity for electrical energy. This new resource will also increase the potential for utilising locally produced solar electricity. The load on the grid will be reduced while the potential for new production of solar electricity increases. - Charging points will be certified for using solar electricity primarily from local or owned production. If locally produced solar energy is not available; the charging point will be supplied with solar power from other producers through issued guarantees of origin. Charging electric vehicles at a certified solar charging point can be sure to always get 100% solar. - If a solar power installation is connected directly to the charging points the vehicles can be charged with higher power when the sun is shining; which requires a straight-forward control. The self consumption can be increased and the purchased electricity reduced. With so-called forecast control the charging can also be controlled by the estimated future solar radiation. With Solarcharge Systems charging peak loads can also be avoided during high electricity prices; or when other needs must be prioritised.,"solelia combines solar panels with electric vehicle (ev) charging stations in a flexible and innovative system, that can be used by families, businesses or municipalities. solelia’s ‘solbank’ is exactly what it sounds like: a bank for solar energy. every kwh produced in a connected solar installation is deposited into the owner’s solar account and can then be used at any time – even when the sun is not shining. this can be used by people who own an electric vehicle or companies who wish to offer solar charging services to customers. solelia greentech offers solutions for charging electric vehicles with clean solar electricity around the clock, with the solbank system. carolina johansson – co-founder and ceo, solelia greentech using ‘guarantees of origin’ from the grid operator, solelia can confirm that all electricity used to charge evs comes from solar sources, and smart energy meters at the charging stations can communicate regularly with the solbank, allowing close to real-time information of when and where solar power is produced and used. this in turn gives the opportunity to optimize the use of solar power. why you should care transportation accounts for over around half of global oil consumption , and this share will increase if the number of passenger cars doubles as predicted by the iea. replacing gasoline cars with electric cars is not as environmentally friendly if they are driven on fossil fuel-derived electricity. wwf estimates that solelia’s solar-powered charging can save 21 million tons of co2 emissions per year by 2022 .",https://www.solelia.se/,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy,,,,,,Energy & Materials,Expansion of renewables,,B2B; B2C,Developed Markets,,Nascent,Yes,Seed,"833,000",,,,Sweden,,2011,1,,,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,0.5,0,0,0.2,Nascent,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yxney maritime,software drives fuel efficiency improvements for maritime industry,"maress is a cloud-based software which monitors fuel levels from marine vessels and provides insights for reducing fuel usage, costs, and greenhouse gas emissions. the maress software is a cloud-based database assisting marine companies with information they need to cut fuel costs, meet legislative requirements, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. the software identifies periods of excessive consumption and proposes the most effective fuel saving initiatives to make cost and emissions saving for the company. it does this by combining data on fuel levels with other information systems providing weather-routing and ship tracking information. recent european regulation on carbon emissions and fuel consumption forces offshore companies operating in european ports to prepare and submit ship-specific fuel consumption and emissions reports. this is putting pressure on ship managers who have previously not been required to monitor the fuel consumption of their vessels. software systems that do not require file downloads or large bandwidth like maress are naturally in demand as efficient and easy-to-use tools for the offshore sector. so far, maress is already installed on more than 140 ships for norwegian solstadfarstad – one of the world’s largest offshore vessel companies. why you should care the cost for shipping goods has never been as low as now and with increasing demand on goods globally, it could be a challenge to meet the international maritime organisation’s goal to half the total annual greenhouse gas emissions from the marine sector by 2050. monitoring fuel usage and making reductions with software like maress has the potential to help the offshore sector meet their goals.",http://www.yxney.com/,SDG 13: Climate Action,,13.4 Decarbonised Transport,,,,,,,,scandinavia,Unknown,Nascent,Yes,Seed,"241,000",N/A,,High income,Norway,,2014,7,,,,,,Sustainia,TRUE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,0.5,0,0,0.2,Nascent,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Emooter Ltd.,,"Emooter is an early-stage Finnish startup, which has developed and launched an app that helps you and your team improve mental health and wellbeing at work. You can find out your state of wellbeing in minutes. Emooter interviews you and your team with a couple of meaningful and scientifically validated questions each week. You get instant feedback on your mental wellbeing, anxiety, and resilience. Emooter gives you personalized AI-powered suggestions, exercises, and ideas based on your answers i.e. the mental state. You will learn to craft your job and improve wellbeing in a sustainable way. All suggestions and exercises are scientifically validated measures. You will also keep track of wellbeing together with your team. Emooter makes changes to wellbeing visible throughout the week, month, and year. You can prevent problems and boost positive changes together with your team, but also react fast enough in the new remote working conditions.<br><br>*Why is this important?*<br><br>The modern work life has become stressful already before the COVID19 pandemic and the future aftermath of it. During the last decades the mental virus of exhaustion, stress and burnouts (including early retirements due to mental illnesses) has spread globally like viruses in real-life. Now facing the pandemic, people are working in new conditions and under a lot of extra stress during the pandemic. <br><br>This will affect people&rsquo;s mental health and wellbeing but also businesses&rsquo; and organizations&rsquo; ability to perform during the crisis and when recovering from it. According to the research by Dr. Wilmar Schaufeli,[the burnout rate in the EU was close to 10 % (https://www.wilmarschaufeli.nl/publications/Schaufeli/500.pdf) and it varied between 4,3 % (Finland) and 20,6 % (Slovenia). Not recently done, but the Last deep-dive in the EU showed that the cost of burnout and exhaustion is at least &euro;20 billion (https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/336011) per year. According to another study, the cost of stress is more than &euro;600 billion in the EU (https://www.eurocadres.eu/stress-at-work-a-cost-to-reduce/) per year. The number of burnouts and the costs associated will surely increase now in the pandemic crisis and current working conditions. We don&rsquo;t yet have enough data on the impact and costs of the current crisis.<br><br>HR and leadership are also facing new challenges. They have too much workload already and are failing to support the work communities. They need help in assessing the mental wellbeing issues, spotting emerging problems early on, and focusing their support and efforts on those teams and people who need it the most. But it is not only HR who needs support in this new situation. We ALL need support today and when facing the long-term effects of the pandemic.<br><br>Even if you still can continue working, you have to learn new ways of organizing your work, collaborating with your team, and balancing work and family. At the same time, stress and anxiety have increased, but we all are more alone than ever before and have to tackle these issues in isolation.<br><br>We need more support at work and we long for the social relationships with our friends, families, colleagues, and customers. It&rsquo;s now harder to get any support from colleagues or supervisors with limited or no connection with them.<br><br>This is why we want to help teams and organizations to take better care of their mental wellbeing together.",https://www.emooter.com/,,,,,,Direct,,,B2B,,Go to market,,,,Bootstrapping,,,,Developed and emerging markets,Finland,,2016,1-10,,,,,,The Hub,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,Looking for funding,,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,TRUE,SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals,

Production today is focused on producing cheap electronics that we simply buy, use and discard. <br><br>Today&acute;s cities are built around the paradigm of mass consumption and the modern consumer owns a constantly increasing stockpile of discardable electronics. This has made plastics and electronics waste generation a growing concern all across the globe at the same time as the world&acute;s resources are strained ever so intensely.

We bring charging into the era of the sharing economy by offering rented power banks with charging cables for all devices all around your city. With an easy scan of a QR code on the stations, users get a fully charged power bank that they can bring with them and keep for up to 5 days. When the user is ready, the rental can be ended by just inserting the power bank into any chosen station, that automatically locks the power bank and ends the rental in the users app. <br><br>It is important for us to keep prices low enough to actually change charging behavior, and show the benefits of sharing over owning. <br><br>By bringing charging into the era of the sharing economy we create a circular market for electronics, and maximize their utilization through sharing within the community.

min skov,,"The Pitch<br>Connect the app to your bank and receive a customized analysis on your carbon footprint in the form of a forest. Offset your individualized calculated carbon emissions by planting trees in the app. <br><br>The What<br>Based on our research, people would like to better understand their environmental impact. However, the current solutions are considered to be very time-consuming and tedious. Questions such as average meat consumption and kilometers traveled by car are difficult to estimate. But even if people manage to calculate their carbon footprint, we realized that they have trouble interpreting the result, as this is often an abstract number in kilograms of CO2. Hence, we identified an opportunity to help people understand their environmental impact visually, to encourage them to take action against climate change and deforestation.<br><br>The How<br>We believe our solution is a unique approach, as it is based on automation and convenience. In the first step, the user links the app to his bank account from our banking partners in the Nordics. In the app, you can see your own virtual forest. Whenever you spend money, the carbon footprint of this transaction is calculated instantly and results in trees being cut down. There are two ways to compensate for your impact: you can adapt your consumer behaviour to help the forest recover. Or you can plant new trees that not only appear in your virtual forest but are planted in the real world..<br><br>The Why<br>We want to involve more people in the fight against the very serious problem of climate change. We aim that people make a difference by planting trees to compensate for their carbon footprint. The idea Breathe was born amongst three friends in the Interaction Design Programme at CIID in 2019.

Of these, nearly 160 million are forced to fetch dirty drinking water from open sources such as lakes, rivers and ponds. The causes of the water shortage are several, but climate change, drought, desertification, pollution and war are important explanations for the water shortage.

We use clean drinking water to flush the toilet, water the lawn and wash the car. <br><br>The How<br>On average, it takes several hundred liters to wash a car through a traditional car wash. Even worse for the environment is if you wash the car on the street, then the toxins run out into the storm water.

Today, around one third of all produced food is lost or wasted throughout the food supply chain. A large part of the losses happen at the post-harvest stage due to inability of farmers to immediately sell, properly process and safely store their produce. In developing countries, these challenges are direct cauces of poverty and hunger (SDG 1 and 2). By giving the farmers a solution to preserve their harvested crops, it gives them an opportunity to store the food much longer for their own consumption or to sell it in the market after the peek season when the prices go up. For the farmers and the families, this means better health and well-being (SDG 3), and economic growth (SDG 8). <br><br>The How<br>In UpFood we have invented a novel, patent-pending, off-grid, solar-hybrid dehydrating technology to reduce on-farm food loss in the post-harvest to storage stage of the food supply chain.

 <br>1) Utilisation of forest resources is inefficient and depresses margins. 2) Risks from climate change such as damage from storm, pests and fires are not well understood and therefore not managed. 3) Trees are the best method known to humanity to absorb CO2.

Peppy Pals,,"The Pitch
 <br>A play-based, social and emotional learning app that allows all children ages 2-8 to play and learn essential skills for a prosperous future.
 <br>
 <br>The What
 <br>Over the past 30 years we have become 40% less empathic, and over 550 million (13% of the world&rsquo;s population) are suffering from mental health problems. Both of which derives from an underserved development of social and emotional skills (SEL). Global organisations such as World Economic Forum and OECD also notes that SEL is a crucial skill set in the future workforce. Research also shows that SEL can improve students&rsquo; performance by as much as 11 percentile points.
 <br>
 <br>The numbers are in. If children under five are equipped with SEL, they have a much better foundation for reaching their fullest potential later in life. However, there&rsquo;s a lack of playful tools to do so, and an urgent need to level the playing field. As Minouche Shafik said: &ldquo;In the past, jobs were about muscles, now they&rsquo;re about brains, but in the future they&rsquo;ll be about the heart&rdquo;, which is why Peppy Pals has created &ldquo;a world where hearts grow smart&rdquo;.
 <br>
 <br>The How
 <br>To give children the skills they need to reach their fullest potential, and at the same time level the playing field, we must consciously tap into every child&rsquo;s social and emotional intelligence as part of the early childhood development.
 <br> 
 <br>Peppy Pals is the first company in the world to gamify social and emotional intelligence without language. Our unique approach uses storytelling, humor and qualitative animations. Through five gender-neutral characters children explore scenarios relatable to real life that also sparks parent-child conversations. 
 <br>
 <br>Our easy-to-use application has proven to reduce conflicts, form stronger relationships and help children talk vividly about emotions. By using a non-language method we have created a basis from which we can reach millions of children globally, including vulnerable populations and those affected by conflict, which makes us eager to continue to change lives on a much larger scale.
 <br>
 <br>The Why
 <br>Peppy Pals was founded by Rosie Linder in 2013. With two daughters growing up in the digital era, Rosie had a dream to create high-quality games for children that were both entertaining and educational. She understood the importance of social and emotional learning and noted the difficulties with introducing and explaining more complex emotions to toddlers without playful tools that captures their attention. The idea of Peppy Pals was born. 
 <br>
 <br>Rosie partnered with the award-winning game developers at Talawa Games and psychologist Bodil Wennberg with the aim of creating a fun, interactive app that teach children valuable lessons in emotional intelligence. In April 2014, Peppy Pals released our first app featured by world-wide by Google Play and Amazon. Since then, we have released several apps, books, a TV-serie with Viaplay and an educational tool.

Hopspots,,"The Pitch<br>Hopspots aims to create more fun, healthy and active school days, by combining learning with movement.<br><br>The What<br>It makes perfect sense to make active learning a part of teaching on schools, unfortunately it is difficult for teachers to succeed with it in practice. They lack time and hands to do it with thus the desire to create active learning is a cause of frustration and challenge. 
 <br>
 <br>Research also shows that pupils learn better and more when they move. That is because movement increases the blood flow to the brain, which increases focus and working memory. But, making sure that the pupils get to move in their everyday school life and teaching can be difficult and time consuming in practice.<br><br>The How<br>This is why we created Hopspot, an interactive learning tool that is designed to actively engage children in their learning by combining it with play and movement. Hopspots consists of 12 wireless spots that are connected to an app for iPad and a speaker uniter, and in that way combines technology with the physical space and focuses on children&rsquo;s interaction.
 <br>
 <br>Our product trains body and memory whilst playing and learning. Thus, it can be used at all ages. For instance, Hopspots can help 3-year-old children recognize animal sounds, 7-year-old children with learning the alphabet, 10-year-old children with multiplication and division, 15-year-old children with collaboration and discussion, and help elderly citizens with having fun while preventing dementia and other age-related illnesses.<br><br>The Why<br>Aviaja came up with the idea for Hopspots 10 years ago when she needed a topic for her master&rsquo;s project at Aarhus School of Architecture. She was passioned in finding a way to combine technology and physical space with focus on children and their interaction. 
 <br>
 <br>For several years no one worked on Hopspots. But with the arrival of the new school reform in 2014 new opportunities for development arose and Aviaja chose to make Hopspots a reality. Movement was now a requirement in teaching which perfectly matched Hopspots&rsquo; philosophy, namely movement, learning and play all in one. New technologies, such as the iPad, made it easier to bring the idea to life and the market had matured and was now ready for the product.",https://www.hopspots.dk/en,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production,,,,,Indirect,,,B2B,,Go to market,,,,,,,,Developed markets,,,2014,,,,,,,The Hub,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,Currently not looking for funding,,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,TRUE,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production,

Kanpla,,"The Pitch<br>Kanpla is developing a digital platform to help canteens reduce food waste by taking orders.<br><br>The What<br>Food waste is an enormous sustainability issue. Denmark alone wastes 700,000 tons of food each year. At Kanpla, we care about food waste in school canteens. Without knowing how many people will eat a given meal, canteens have to prepare more food than necessary. Canteens are wasting dozens of kilograms of food every day, and studies show that there is a potential for improvement. Pursuing the goal of Responsible Consumption and Production (UN Goals), we want to reduce food waste in canteens as much as possible.
 <br><br><br>The How<br>Kanpla is a digital platform for ordering canteen food. Through our web application, parents can create a meal plan for their kids in advance. No need to give children money for lunch, the food is already paid for online. Canteens know exactly how many orders there are, so they know exactly how much to cook. They can afford to offer a wide variety of dishes while reducing leftovers, and thus food waste.
 <br><br><br>The Why<br>As students, we had the problem of food waste in canteens right in front of our eyes. Realizing how big the problem actually is, we discovered an enormous business opportunity. The market consists of outdated solutions if any, and it&apos;s here for us to disrupt it.

Air0,,"The Pitch<br>Air0 has developed a care-free total solution for clean indoor air - Clean Air as a Service. It&apos;s a fully programmable &amp; automated clean air system scaling up to any needs. CAaaS model includes indoor air quality monitoring, high-end air purifiers, central management via cloud and expert analysis. <br><br>The What<br>We can survive 30 days without food - for developed countries, one can always choose not to eat rotten food. We can survive 3 days without water - for us, bottled water is available option for places, where the tap water is not clean. But we can only survive 3 minutes without air. We are forced to breathe the air, no matter how polluted it is. <br><br>According to WHO, each year millions of people die as a result of being exposed to bad air quality. The ultra fine particles generated by traffic and burning, are so small, they can penetrate to our blood stream via our lungs. Air pollution will then affect to our health causing lung cancer and other lung diseases, heart attacks and stroke, as well as other, less severe health issues, such as headache, nausea, fatigue and flu. <br><br>For our market, there are two big issues causing polluted indoor air; very polluted outdoor air, which leaks indoors effectively (e.g. in China) and sick building syndrome (e.g. in Finland). <br><br>The How<br>The core of our solution is the unique and patented smAIRt&reg; technology. It combines the best of the traditional air purification technologies, mechanical and electrical filtration, to achieve maximal amounts of clean air. For air purification, it is the most important factor. <br><br>Since perfecting the purification technology and creating two beautiful stand-alone products out of it, we have also taken a step further, to provide our customers the best possible service, in a simple and easy way from set-up to usage. We call it Clean Air as a Service. CAaaS was launched in 2019, and it is a fully scalable, full-service concept for delivering clean air. <br><br>Our CAaaS model is an IoT solution, enabling real-time follow up for air quality in all the different rooms and properties at a glance. Air purification is fully automated, fully programmable and centrally managed for all the rooms. Expert reports and analysis are available, maintenance and support is included in the service fee. <br><br>The Why<br>The idea for Air0 came from one of our co-founders, Mr. Rajala. He has decades of experience with aerosol physics and fine-particles, and just before Air0, he was involved in the indoor air industry in the Asian market. While spending time there, it became obvious that there was a serious air quality problem and people were desperately searching for a solution. They needed air purifier that was capable of producing large amounts of pure air, while being silent, energy efficient and requiring little maintenance. They needed a new innovation for the air purification. And that was the challenge Mr. Rajala was ready to face. <br>From day 0, Air0 has been eyeing to China market and today we already have a distributor in China. <br><br>Other team members have various reasons that drive them every day; passion for hi-tech and cleantech development, some have personal background with indoor air quality issues and others are just keen to provide cleaner air for people.",https://air0.fi/about-us/#our-story,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production,,,,,Indirect,,,B2B,,Growth and expansion,,,,,,,,Developed and emerging markets,,,2013,,,,,,,The Hub,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,Currently not looking for funding,,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,TRUE,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production,
Decideret Cider,,"The Pitch<br>We want to make the best wild cider in the world on 100 % Danish apples and prove that cider can be every bit as quenchy and informal as beer, as complex as wine, as sour as lambic, and as fruitful as freshly squeezed juice. <br><br>The What<br>Every year, in the private gardens of Denmark, 5 million kilos of apples fall from trees and are abandoned. On the island of Fyn (Funen, eng) there is a long-standing tradition of handing in surplus fruit to the cidery in &Oslash;rb&aelig;k where apple donors sign a paper stating that no pesticides have been used. This is ecology and old school reduction of food waste without a label. This year we have filled some of our fermentation tanks with juice from these crispy garden apples of Fyn. We also use selected varieties from Lille&oslash; for our small-batch cuv&eacute;es.
 <br>
 <br>At Decideret Cider we do cider workshops and DIY-courses as well with the sustainable initiative GroSelv and Meyers Madhus &ndash; because real cider is in fact something everyone in possession of good apples can make. We are also one of the initiators and organizers behind Rigtig Cider - Copenhagen Cider Festival. 
 <br><br><br>The How<br>In Denmark we are blessed with apples that balances a tart acidity with a fruitful apple sweetness. Our cider culture is on the other hand depleted. Our food culture has been elevated with the new nordic kitchen - now it is time to take a look at what we drink.
 <br>
 <br>We crush and press apples, ferment juice into cider, and bottle it by hand in small and big bottles - cider can be kept well in both a wine cellar and in a breast pocket. Some ciders are to be drunk young and fresh with a full throttle apple flavour. Other ciders gain flavour when aged in oak. For all our ciders we can say that they are wild fermented and they are made solely from Danish apples with a focus on craftsmanship, curiosity and reducing food waste. In Copenhagen we distribute all our ciders ourselves on an electric cargo bike with a trailer.<br><br>The Why<br>It all started in the late summer of 2015 in N&oslash;rrebroparken in Copenhagen. We were five old friends wondering why we in Denmark don&rsquo;t have a culture for drinking good cider. France, England and Spain all have their own proud traditions and vinification techniques. In august that year we borrowed a press and went straight at it. We gathered apples from the gardens and parks of Copenhagen and ended up with a small production; we filled some 100 bottles in a garage next to Utterslev Mose in the northwestern part of Copenhagen.
 <br>
 <br>The following year we moved &ldquo;the production&rdquo; into a container under Bispeengbuen in N&oslash;rrebro/Frederiksberg where we made some highly explosive cider. Next stop was Gr&oslash;nttorvet (the old vegetable market of Copenhagen) where we produced around 3000 L of highly drinkable cider. We delivered the cider on our bikes to bars, special kiosks and restaurants around Copenhagen and when the summer of 2018 ended - we had been on sale for 5 months - we were sold out.",https://www.decideretcider.dk,,,,,,Indirect,,,B2B,,Growth and expansion,,,,,,,,Developed and emerging markets,,,2017,,,,,,,The Hub,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,Looking for funding,,  ,TRUE,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being,
SON OF A TAILOR,,"The Pitch<br>The future of clothing will be formed by challenging convention, and embracing innovation. We celebrate the principles of a truly custom made piece of clothing,
 <br>and embrace technology that allows us to make it available to everyone, everywhere.<br><br>The What<br>The throwaway culture is an unfortunate part of fashion. If you&rsquo;ve only paid $8 for a T-Shirt, what&rsquo;s stopping you from buying another one once the first loses its shape after a few wears? Seven wears. That&rsquo;s the average life span of a high street garment before it is discarded. It seems that, somewhere along the line, we stopped caring about the things we buy.
 <br>
 <br>Let&rsquo;s just say we&rsquo;re partisan here. We make T-Shirts in a radically different way. But this is a problem. It&rsquo;s a problem that lies with both consumers and manufacturers, and it leads to an enormous amount of waste for the environment, and a careless attitude to products and people.<br><br>The How<br>Sustainability is at the core of what we do. By having no inventories and very low returns of goods sold we obtain a CO2 footprint half of other fashion commerce retailers. Plus, by having full control over our supply chain, we can make sure our seamstresses and pattern-makers are working under better circumstances.
 <br>
 <br>Each year, more than 2 billion T-Shirts are sold, making it one of the best-selling clothing categories in the world. At the same time, we believe it is one of the most neglected. We decided the T-Shirt was the most impactful place to start making fashion better &ndash; for the consumer, for the environment, and for the people involved in the production. 
 <br>
 <br>Every T-Shirt we produce is accompanied by a hangtag. It is signed by the seamstress who custom-fitted the garment, and it&rsquo;s addressed to the person receiving it. The hangtag is a small gesture, which at the same time embodies the essence of Son of a Tailor. It serves as a reminder that the T-Shirt is made to order and sewn specifically for that person&rsquo;s unique measurements, and that a real person constructed it.
 <br>
 <br><br><br>The Why<br>We partner with carefully selected production facilities in the EU who are as passionate about making fashion better. They challenge us, and we challenge them, which is an important dynamic because it&rsquo;s the only way we can make better products and a better industry.
 <br>
 <br>The result is garments that are timeless and built to last for years. We hope and think that&rsquo;s where fashion is headed &ndash; to a place where we focus less on buying more, and more on owning fewer quality garments that we wear for years. Garments that are more sustainable, of higher quality, and constructed with longevity as its main purpose.
 <br>
 <br>That&rsquo;s the staple of Son of a Tailor. And we&rsquo;re fiercely passionate about becoming your staple, too.

MicroWISE,,"The Pitch<br>Microwise has develope a test kit for automatic detection of live organisms in ballast water, Ballastwise, which will help the shipping industry staying compliant with the new IMO ballat water regulations. <br><br>The What<br>Shipping has been identified as a major pathway for introducing invasive species to new environments. The effects of the introduction of new species have in many areas of the world been devastating. In order to prevent the spread of harmful aquatic organisms from one region to another the Ballast Water Management Convention has been adopted by the The International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the US Coast Guard. Under the Convention, all ships in international traffic are required to clean their ballast water to a certain standard. A number of approved ballast water management systems are available on the market, however, there are no approved systems for which can automatically test water quality according to the IMO and USCG ballast water standards. <br><br>The How<br>BallastWISE represents a new method for quantifying microbial life in relation to existing instruments used for testing ballast water. Manual microscopy using motility and fluorescence is still the benchmark against which automated systems are tested, and in many ways, BallastWISE is an automation of that procedure using software, cameras and optical assemblies. Currently, the only excepted compliance test must be performed in the laboratory and is often based on manual microscopy, which is time consuming and expensive. It is our ambition to make BallastWISE the first portable test kit which will go a long way towards a true compliance test in the field. <br><br>The Why<br>We heard about the Ballast water convention back in 2013, before it was adopted by the IMO. At that time the market for Ballast Water Management Systems (BWMS) was developing, but there was very little interest in test-systems for ballast water quality. However, we were sure that test tools eventually would be needed. We had worked with image analysis based tools and camera-technology for analysis of micro-organisms for many years, and had software tools that we found suitable for automatic testing of live organisms in water samples. We applied for funding from several Danish funds, who supported the development of Ballastwise, which was much more challenging than we initially thought it would be.

 <br>
 <br>The cashew is popularly known as the &lsquo;poor man&rsquo;s crop and &lsquo;rich man&rsquo;s food&rsquo;.

It is estimated that in the EU alone, more than 4.000 stadiums exploit up to 40 TWH/year, with the largest stadiums consuming 10.000 MWh/year2. 40 TWH/year is the equivalent of the total power consumption of New Zealand per year, which makes sports stadiums one of the large categories of power consumers in the EU and responsible for 11.5M tons of CO2 emissions/year.<br><br>The How<br>The Second Sun solution is the first of its kind and it constitutes a completely new approach and design in the field of solutions that provides lighting for supporting grass growth in stadium pitches, as it is based on using reflectors installed directly into the roof of the stadium to utilize the rays of the sun instead of electrically powered lighting for cost-effective and environmentally sustainable grass growth support.<br><br>The Why<br>A lot of people have a natural interest in sports and especially in sports that are being played on a natural grass pitch but not a lot of people know the crazy amount of energy that is being used to keep the grass pitches inside sports stadiums nice and green all year round.

Fineswap,,"The Pitch<br>The only app you need to swap your stuff with style 😎
 <br>
 <br>Fineswap is your free, fun, and easy app to swap locally. Browse items for inspiration, upload your own, and match with others whose items you like.<br><br>The What<br>There are 2 main issues we&apos;re tackling:
 <br>
 <br>1) The &ldquo;Coincidence of Wants&rdquo;: Wikipedia describes it as an economic phenomenon where two parties each hold an item the other wants. A bartering economy is founded on such parties exchanging goods, sometimes services, without any monetary medium.
 <br>
 <br>2) The rise of conscious shopping: We&apos;re witnessing an increasing number of conscious shoppers and swappers meeting offline in every corner of the world, but no Internet stage where they can express themselves.

The platform employs machine learning and gamification techniques to connect users with matching interests to each other, thus solving the &ldquo;Coincidence of Wants&rdquo; problem.
 <br>
 <br>To cater for the needs of a growing number of conscious shoppers all around the world, we have plans to further employ gamification in Fineswap by launching virtual swapping rooms. The final concept of how this will look, function, and interact with the users is not yet finalized, but the end result is clear: to enable users to express themselves through Fineswap.<br><br>The Why<br>As the dominant species, humans still have a lot of work ahead of them to turn the world into a better place.

 <br>Fineswap is our contribution towards making the world a better place. We rely on a modern technology to gamify bartering and make swapping fun, social and effective. Bartering has been around for thousands of years and it has proven to be extremely successful in times of need and among both poor and highly educated societies, and the timing is just right!

Rebox AB,,"The Pitch<br>Rebox: a startup applying circular economy to moving boxes<br><br>The What<br>Our current economy is linear and based on a take-make-dispose approach that has proven itself to be highly unsustainable.

This through careful selection of products for the global market, starting with the bag industry.

Healper,,"The Pitch<br>Healper is an online booking platform that matches people with mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety and addiction with the right psychologist that fits<br>their needs.<br><br>The What<br>In Denmark, mental disorders account for 25% of the disease burden and cost society 55 billion DKK annually with more than 2,000 people receiving therapy from a psychologist every day. Further, too many individuals do not receive timely help as they cannot cope with the draining 5-hour process it takes to find and book a psychologist. At the same time, U.S. experience shows that only 20-40% of people find a psychologist they trust and have &acute;chemistry&acute; with. This is tragic, as just one bad experience can cause a client to completely drop out of or postpone his/her therapy. The ineffective booking process and the risk of a poor patient-therapist match mean that many people continue to struggle with mental illness who could otherwise be treated. This has major consequences for individuals whose mental illness markedly impairs their quality of life, but also largely affect their family and friends. Furthermore, this is a major problem for society.<br><br>The How<br>The cornerstone of Healper is an optimal match between each client and psychologist combined with a personal tailormade user journey. The most important factor in the match is optimizing the likelihood of a strong therapeutic alliance between the psychologist and the client. The best condition for this therapeutic alliance appears when the psychologist reminds the client of someone, he/she naturally trusts. Therefore, we determine matches based on the psychologist&rsquo;s experience, geography, style, and demography. We have set up an operational analysis algorithm with variable constraints that mathematically assess the matching parameters and can choose which psychologists best match each client. In the U.S., we have found that these parameters can improve the match rate by approximately 350%. Healper&rsquo;s team has extensive experience in advanced mathematical models and AI, and are using a culturally adapted version of the U.S. algorithm. <br><br>The Why<br>Three years ago, when one of the founders was studying in the United States, he developed with two friends a diary app that uses artiﬁcial intelligence to improve the mental health of psychologists&rsquo; clients.

 <br>
 <br>We do this by developing fresh convenience meals to be offered in supermarkets. Our first couple of meals are already displayed on our website (justplants.dk) and more products will be developed in the coming months.<br><br>The What<br>Climate action: The production of animal products require significantly more land than plantbased products, and they are thus a major souce of deforestation. In the process they also emit more greenhouse (e.g methane from cattle farming). A shift towards more plantbased meals can therefore help slow down the emission of greenhouse gasses.
 <br>
 <br>Life Below Water: The UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that 33% of the world&apos;s fish stocks are subject to overfishing. A shift towards more plantsbased meals will help reduce this figure.
 <br>
 <br>Life on Land: It takes approximately 7 kg of grains to produce 1 kg of beef, and it takes 4 kg of grains to produce 1 kg of pork. These are examples of the land use that is required to produce animal products. A shift towards more plantbased meals will therefore enable reforestation and potentially increase biodiversity.

The SolarSack cleans 4 liters of water within 4 hours and can be refilled 500 times providing a total of 2000 liters of safe water. SolarSack&rsquo;s purification technique is based on the 25 year old solar water disinfection technology, which has been endorsed by the WHO as a safe way to purify drinking water.

 <br>Despite the fact that it&rsquo;s recognised more women in top management has a positive impact on the bottom line, gender equality in Danish leadership roles and management boards leaves a lot to be desired. 
 <br>With 27% of woman in leadership positions Denmark is the lowest ranking of the Nordic countries and even below the OECD average of 31%.1

 <br>One challenge is that candidates to fill top leadership positions are recruited via network and since these are male &lsquo;heavy&rsquo; it creates a vicious circle that takes effort to interrupt.1

Reach Active,,"The Pitch<br>Reach has developed a 100% online physiotherapy app to help MSK pain sufferers (the #1 cause of disability globally) access quality and evidence based care and build up the active habits that are shown to most effectively treat and prevent pain.<br><br>The What<br>Pain management and prevention should be centred around a multidimensional approach - focusing on physical activity and exercise but also on building understanding of pain and the confidence in one&apos;s ability to deal with pain. Frustratingly, MSK pain is a global epidemic, and a lot of the current treatment is part of the problem, not the solution: 1. Still, too many health practitioners promote passive treatment approaches and passive coping strategies. 2. For most, the active approach that best treats pain requires active habits to be formed, which includes both belief and behaviour change. Sadly, no one offers this high-quality care in a way that supports habit change. At Reach, we build up people&rsquo;s ability and confidence to self-manage, so they do not become dependent on health professionals. In everything we do, we strive to make recovery and prevention more reassuring, accessible and motivating.
 <br>
 <br>
 <br><br><br>The How<br>Currently patients complete a 8 minute online assessment and receive a personalised video exercise program, we then motivate and evolve their program to recovery. 
 <br>
 <br>During your time with Reach, we&rsquo;ll work with you to develop the confidence you need to stay active at your own pace, in a way that suits your lifestyle. We&rsquo;ll also support you with ongoing educational material to make sure you fully understand what&rsquo;s going on &lsquo;under the bonnet&rsquo; of your pain. You&rsquo;ll get access to new educational material at checkpoints throughout your road to recovery so that you can make informed choices about how best to deal with your symptoms and keep progressing.<br><br>The Why<br>This is where it all started, and what drives everyone at Reach, everyday.
 <br>
 <br>- We really believe in all the benefits of being active - social, stress relief, increased energy, better health and more.
 <br>- And we admire all those trying their hardest to make themselves and their lives better - and I genuinely believe most people are trying their hardest in life (shout out to Brene Brown&rsquo;s book on Shame and her ted talks for this learning).
 <br>- There are loads of great tools and people helping you to be active and stay active, but when things go wrong and you&rsquo;re held back by pain and injury, the available choices are all so frustratingly inconvenient, slow and boring.
 <br>- SO, we are &lsquo;empowering people when their active best is under threat&rsquo;. And we hope that by helping people become stronger and move forward, we can help make their lives that much better, in-turn increasing their capacity to make the lives of those around them better, and bit by bit we&rsquo;ll make the world that bit better.

 <br>
 <br>In 2009, Per Hassel was involved in a traffic accident as he was hit by a car when riding a regular bike. After that, he did not feel safe on a two-wheeled bike and wanted to develop a more safe and practical velomobile/ e-bike. In parallel he started on a part-time master study within Sustainable Energy Technology and &quot;Velomobil: redefined&quot; became his master thesis. 
 <br>
 <br>The initial idea was to develop a vehicle/ velomobil that was 10 times smaller, 20 times lighter and 30 times more energy-efficient than a car, that should fit in the marketplace somewhere between bicycles and cars.

Ciao Ciao Carsharing AB,,The Pitch<br>Enables car-owners to make money off their unused vehicles while creating a superior car rental service in terms of both price and usability for people in need of a car without owning one.<br><br>The What<br>A privately owned car is standing still 95% of the time on average and costs a lot of money for the owner. We enable the car-owner to share their vehicles with other people and increase the vehicle&apos;s utilization while also generating an income for the owner.

Fishency Innovation,,"The Pitch<br>Fishency uses artificial intelligence and computer vision to improve sustainability in the aquaculture industry<br><br>The What<br>The world needs more food and healthy food. Within 2050 the global demand for protein on our dinner plates is expected to grow by 80%, and there are fewer and fewer options to expand on land. Farmed proteins from the ocean have only a fraction of the environmental impact as farmed proteins from land-based animals. But, it needs to be as sustainable as possible, and with as little impact on the environment and life in water as possible. Norway is the biggest salmon producer in the world, however, sea lice are their major challenge. Sea lice are the reason the industry cannot grow and causes severe issues when it comes to sustainability. The spread of sea lice threatens salmon production and the environment. If allowed to reach full size, sea lice prevent fish from growing, ultimately resulting in mortality. The aquaculture industry needs high-quality data to combat sea lice spread, cut treatment costs, improve fish welfare, reduce losses and protect the environment.<br><br>The How<br>Fishency is developing a digital sea lice counting solution which we call the Smartfunnel. The SmartFunnel eliminates labor-intensive sampling methods and allows fish farmers to take a larger sample size, giving them better decision support to optimize treatment and measure the effectiveness of preventive measures. It also improves accuracy and repeatability and can increase productivity and reduce the environmental impact of fish farms.
 <br>
 <br>Primarily designed for sea lice counting, the solution can also be used for measuring biomass, identifying external deformities, ulcers or damage, as well as for monitoring the environment of the fish. In the future, it will have the capacity to identify individual salmon. Looking ahead, such a technology could be adapted for use with rainbow trout and potentially other farmed fish as well.<br><br>The Why<br>The co-founder Flavie Gohin joined an accelerator X2 Labs and had the chance to review the various problems the industry has to solve with the support from major actors of the aquaculture industry. When she learned how sea lice were monitored today at the farms, she just knew that there were new solutions and technologies available that could improve significantly the process for sea lice monitoring. She quickly assessed the impact of having access to highly reliable sea lice data for the industry to contribute to better prevention and prediction. Since then, she built up progressively a team who shared the same drives and passion.

Indo Naturals,,"The Pitch<br>Indo Naturals delivers plant-based products helping people on the journey to sustainable everyday consumption.<br><br>The What<br>We are simply unable to deal with the huge amounts of plastic waste we produce and consume. Only about 25% of the household plastic waste is sorted out for recycling. In the western world, large parts of this is never actually recycled, but reach the oceans through the international plastic trade system. 70 000 containers of plastic waste was sent from Europe to Asia for recycling in 2018. Much ending up at low cost recycling facilities leaking into the oceans.

With this current trend there will be more plastics than fishes in the ocean. 
 <br>EU has recently passed a resolution on single use plastic ban. Also, the consumers, especially in the developed world has started demanding more sustainable products.
 <br>We at Leafymade plans to target this problem by providing alternative sustainable solutions.<br><br>The How<br>Our idea is to use natural, biodegradable materials to make sustainable disposable products that can go as an organic waste after its use. This means Leafymade products leaves nothing behind. For example our tableware like disposable plates, bowls, dip bowls etc are made up of leaves and only leaves. Our product are the perfect alternate of one time disposable plates made of paper and plastics. Our products are suatainable and goes back into the nature in only 2-3 weeks without leaving any footprints on the environment. No chemical and pesticides are used in the process. It also give the impression of the step towards the sustainable future.

This has a huge effect on quality and taste.<br><br>The How<br>By cutting out the many middlemen of the industry, we are able to pay fishermen 3x more for their fish than the current buyers and still sell cheaper to consumers than competitors. This solves two pains: fishermen will earn liveable wage, and the produce will be affordable to the customers. Further, by locally sourcing we eliminate the need for extensive transportation and are able to deliver seafood on the same day it is caught, addressing the second consumer pain.<br><br>The value proposition is therefore monetary for both parts, as well as delivering a higher quality (fresher) product than any competitor. Being based on technology, we are the first actors in the industry that creates full transparency into the source of the seafood, which is especially of interest to our B2B customers that can use these details for their own quality control and story-telling to their consumers.<br><br>The Why<br>We noticed that fresh fish is nearly impossible to come-by in Denmark, despite the fact this it is a country surrounded more than 8,000 km of coastline. And even the fish that is available, which is on average 4 days and up to 16 days old, is quite expensive. Meanwhile, the small-scale fishermen are struggling to survive in the industry. But it doesn&apos;t have to be this way. I used to spend my childhood summers in Maine, where we would buy fresh lobster directly from the local fishermen. It was fresh, cheap, and we were able to form a relationship and get to know the fishermen. We were surprised that there was no good solution to these problems on the marked. So we decided to start Blue Lobster to create a solution to simultaneously benefit the fishermen, the consumers, and the environment.",https://bluelobster.app/da/hjem/,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production,,Network,,,Indirect,Food,,B2B,,Product or prototype,Logistics,Nascent,Yes,Seed,,,,Developed and emerging markets,Denmark,,2018,1-10,,,,,,The Hub,FALSE,FALSE,,TRUE,FALSE,,0.5,0,1,0.2,Nascent,,,,0,,Currently not looking for funding,,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,"SDG 12, SDG 13"

Drupps,,"The Pitch<br>Drupps turns air into clean drinking water wherever you are in the world. At any time.<br><br>The What<br>Water scarcity is building up all over the world, forcing us to think about water in new ways. We need to use less, recycle more, and find new sources. The atmosphere is such a source and Drupps is focused on bringing it to you.
 <br>
 <br>We envision urban areas in 2040 to be producing their own drinking water straight from the air. This will reduce limits to growth and help them find a sustainable balance with nature. Eco pressure on groundwater, rivers and lakes will be reduced, to the benefit of the entire eco system in the region.
 <br><br><br>The How<br>Drupps Concept is based on two modules &ndash; humidity absorption and evaporation &ndash; that combine together to create powerful and flexible atmospheric water generation.

Blue Lice AS,,"The Pitch<br>Blue Lice switches focus from treatment to prevention of sea lice. Its system acts like a mosquito trap, attracting, capturing and containing sea lice before they reach the salmon.<br><br>The What<br>The global need for protein is growing. Salmon is an excellent source of animal protein, with a relatively small carbon footprint.
 <br>
 <br>The Norwegian authorities have set a goal to increase production five-fold by 2050. Sea lice, however, pose the greatest challenge to achieving this goal. The parasite feeds on salmon&rsquo;s skin and tissue, making the fish more prone to infection, trauma and stress. 
 <br>
 <br>In 2016 alone, 53 million salmon died in their pens in Norwegian fish farms, mostly due to sea lice. Treatment costs for fish farmers are estimated at USD 1.3 billion annually (excluding revenue losses).<br><br>The How<br>Blue Lice&rsquo;s patent pending system consists of physical units which are placed around a fish farming pen. Each unit is a trap that lures in sea lice through a combination of attractors and then contains them. The system takes advantage of the sea lice&rsquo;s instincts by amplifying attractors, light and odorant, making the trap more attractive than the salmon.
 <br>
 <br>Preventing sea lice from entering fish farms in the first place minimises the need for treatment, which often involves stressful fish handling or potentially harmful drugs or chemicals. Use of Blue Lice&rsquo;s system in combination with other measures such as cleaner fish will keep the number of sea lice below permitted limits.

Ceretai,,"The Pitch<br>At Ceretai we are all about the future. We are creating a machine learning tool to analyze popular culture based on biases, stereotypes and norms. 
 <br><br><br>The What<br>Our mission is to create an inclusive and diverse media industry. The problem is that we are getting used to biases and stereotypes in media. We are not even thinking about it, but imagine what impact it might have on our opinions, self-esteem and understanding of the world. Only 30% of the speaking roles in movies are female, and far less than 1% of movies are directed by a person of color. <br><br>The How<br>We want to do this with data driven analysis of media content. We are developing an &quot;Equality API&quot; where clients can input files and get diversity based outputs. Our first algorithm generated speaking time between men and women. Also, when we cross reference this data with ROI, amount of viewers and target group appeal we can look at trends and we have seen a correlation between diversity and profit.<br><br>The Why<br>During the #metoo peek our CEO wanted to hold a speech about inequalities on her workplace (a big swedish bank), but got refused due to company politics. This made her realize that she would rather work for equality, than for the bank. And the first seed of what was going to be Ceretai was planted. Equality is a big subject, and one can not do all, but we have choosen to focus on the media industry. This because we believe that it hold a huge role when it comes to us consumers building opinions and normalizing inequalities. What if our children could grow up with relatable role models?

Develop Diverse,,"The Pitch
 <br>Develop Diverse has built an AI-based software tool that helps companies build diverse and inclusive workplaces by eliminating social stereotypic content across companies&apos; communication channels.
 <br>
 <br>The What
 <br>Develop Diverse is the world&rsquo;s first software tool that automatically analyses stereotypic content for gender, age and ethnicity in texts and proposes non-stereotypic alternatives. Thus, allowing HR and communication managers making their recruitment and communication content inclusive and thus helping them reach a wider and more diverse talent pool that also shares their company&rsquo;s vision and values.
 <br>
 <br>The How
 <br>Our tool, the DD-scan is an AI-based software tool that promotes inclusive writing that will enable you to reach a wider and more diverse talent pool. The DD-scan detects and colour-highlights implicitly and explicitly stereotypic language in your texts and suggests neutral alternatives in real-time. 
 <br>
 <br>The Why
 <br>Scientific studies have proven that the use of stereotypic language when writing job ads is common practice, and this clearly has a psychological effect on potential applicants. Such language makes these job ads biased towards specific demographic groups, discouraging other groups from applying and this effect can reduce the applicant pool by as much as 50%. As these stereotypes are embedded in our written and spoken language, detecting and replacing it takes much more than just a glance at a short list of words to avoid or even a weekend&rsquo;s training.",https://www.developdiverse.com,,,,,,Indirect,,,B2B,,Product or prototype,,,,,,,,Developed and emerging markets,Denmark,,2017,1-10,,,,,,The Hub,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,Looking for funding,,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities,SDG 5

I learned that nowadays we spend 90% of our time indoors missing the connection to greenery, I researched the indoor climate and its impact on people&apos;s well being and I found proving the benefits of plants. That all led to my decision of starting the company to create smart, high-quality, sustainable designs for greenery.

Swancy,,"The Pitch<br>Swancy is a platform for swapping clothes where people can give their preloved, but no longer used items a new home while getting something they fancy in return.<br><br>The What<br>We believe the throwaway culture that has emerged undermines the real value of fashion. Our closets are full of items we don&apos;t wear. Creating new clothes is a costly process both in terms of the environmental cost of producing fabric material, and in terms of labour cost of production. At the same time, fashion is meant to be enjoyed. We need to think differently and be smarter in the way we consume clothes, particularly in developed countries where abundance is becoming an environmental challenge. Through Swancy we promote sustainability through reuse and give people a chance to make use of the resources they have. <br><br>The How<br>Swapping is a win-win situation and one of the most sustainable and economical ways to enjoy fashion. Our aim is therefore to make swapping available for everyone at all times. We wish to inspire people to invest in quality rather than quantity. Sustainable and ethically produced products tend to be more expensive. Swancy provides a way for people to focus on quality while still having the freedom to experiment with their style. <br><br>The Why<br>We personally love swapping and find that both receiving and giving away preloved items sparks a lot of joy. Swancy&apos;s founder was inspired by the Nordic Swap Day, organised in Norway by Naturvernforbundet. She wanted to create a swap-option that was available throughout the year.

 <br>Business owners or entrepreneurs can focus on their products and not on all the technical stuff, maintenance and SEO, that an e-commerce site requires.<br><br>The How<br>We have built a platform that resembles Amazon or Etzy in many ways, but with the clear difference that we only want to sell sustainable goods. We want to support small startups and help them get their products to market in an easy way, but we also want to attract bigger e-Commerce sites and provide an option for them, to feed their products to Weensu.dk.

 <br>The city of Ry that we live in has a great focus on sustainability. The idea for Weensu.dk came in connection with a store that one of us owners (Mia) already had. The store is based on sharing economy principles. 
 <br>After finding each other through mutual acquaintances, we agreed to start Weensu.dk, where some of the same principles should be disseminated online.
 <br>
 <br>We wanted to make an impact and the opening of yet another webshop with our own products, was not a solution.

 <br>
 <br>11-12 | Sustainable cities &amp; communities / consumption &amp; production
 <br>By enabling &ldquo;just in time&rdquo; consumption of local produce and making local food production profitable, we keep local jobs as well as reducing waste and energy across the whole value chain (producer&gt;wholesale&gt;retail&gt;consumer).

 <br>due to a number of circumstances, such as being a foodie, the father of to two girls at 3 and 7, having just finished a strategy project at eBay based on platform strategy thinking, getting the right exit opportunity, meeting up with a guy that had spent almost two years visiting small local food producers and being fascinated by a shift in consumer behavior an idea of a new company with a new business model emerged.

 <br>
 <br>Most of the yogurt available in the supermarket are not healthy or nutritious, containing high amounts of sugar and food additives/ preservatives (generally as hidden ingredients), extended shelf life (up to 30 days old!) and also contributing to the production of disposable plastic packaging.
 <br>
 <br>Our product is based on innovative patent-pending technology in both the devices and pods (which is currently being developed in partnership with Chalmers and Lund University in Sweden). <br><br>The Why<br>Three years ago I watched a video from the American researcher Caleb Harper (TED Talk &quot;This Computer Will Grow Your Food in the Future&quot; ) which shared the information that the average time that takes for fruits and veggies to reach supermarkets since harvesting in the US is 11 months.

From that moment I decided that I would dedicate my time and work to change this situation spreading knowledge about food and empowering consumers with innovative products which could both decentralize and optimize food production and consumption.
 <br>And that&apos;s where the idea of YOGUT came from.

The situation today for many is that a lot of food items are just sitting in peoples pantries and fridges until they get spoiled and need to be thrown away.

Usually there are a couple of ingredients that are soon to expire so I wanted to use them but I didn&apos;t want to go out to shop new groceries. I wanted to cook something with the ingredients I already had at home. The thought then struck me that instead of searching and scrolling through recipes to find something you like, it would be a much better process to first only see the recipes that you can actually make with the ingredients you have at home, then choose from that much more narrow set of recipes.<br>I searched for an app or service that did this but could not find any that did it well.

Unfortunately, 42% of foreign assignments end because the family fails to integrate. The key to retaining that talent is successful integration of the family. But, so often is the case that international families who arrive in Sweden, because of work, love or study, fall through the public integration process cracks.

First of all congestion decreases as a shared car is estimated to replace around 8-10 renters according to research. This also is connected parking, where the same metrics apply. The second impact of car sharing is that car sharing decreases the demand for newly produced cars. This is done by not only decreasing demand for the actual cars, but research also shows that car sharers decrease their mobility need over time, so behaviour (not only need for car) is positively impacted.<br><br>The How<br>Our mission is to have 5 million fewer cars in Europe by 2022, with more space and decreased CO2 emissions as a result.

Swapster,,"The Pitch<br>Swapster is a fun and easy app that enables barter! It&apos;s a community-driven marketplace that offers new ways to consume - without having to buy anything at all!<br><br>The What<br>Recent years&apos; discussions on sustainability have often focused on consumption. Of course, we need to change our consumption patterns to stop wasting the earth&apos;s resources. But an important issue that is easily forgotten is about how we use what we already have. Your forgotten shirt, the jeans in the wrong size, the party outfit that you&apos;re tired of, the ice-skates you never have time to skate with - all these things could be used by someone else instead of collecting dust in your home. The sooner we realize that we need to take advantage of what we already have, the better.
 <br>
 <br>According to a survey by Myrorna, 89% state that they have
 <br>clothes at home that do not use, because they are in the wrong size, you have tired of them or we have simply forgot about them. An unused garment is an unused resource, especially as recent research has shown that as much as 70% of a garment&apos;s climate impact occurs during production<br><br>The How<br>Swapster creates the worlds first shared closet and storage. The platform enables a &quot;virtual&quot; storage that they share with their friends and people nearby. It is a community where you swap your belongings with each other! 
 <br>
 <br>Swapster enables barter. It is about changing &quot;real value&quot; to another &quot;real value&quot;. When you swap, you get something back for what you give, the change happens if both see that they get a higher value in each other&apos;s real goods. Swapping is a smart way to save money. When you sell a second hand you usually do not get back what you bought the case for new price, but when you change, you have the opportunity to switch to something that has the equivalent value.<br><br>The Why<br>Ebba (the founder) used to work for H&amp;M and realized that I wanted to make a true difference! The society that we live in now promote shopping and you get the feeling thet you never have enough, I started to question this lifestyle and wanted to promote something mindful, minimalistic and sustainable instead. I came up with the idea when I worked on an innovation project at H&amp;M and decided that I wanted to do it and scale the idea. Now I am full time entrepreneur and I have quitted my full time job to fulfill this dream!

Roju,,"The Pitch<br>Roju is an online rental service for quality products with delivery and pickup.<br><br>The What<br>The consumption of manufactured goods contributes to 17 % of global household greenhouse gas emissions. The sharing economy is on the rise, but stuck with a chicken-and-egg problem due to a p2p marketplace focus:
 <br>
 <br>1) There&apos;s not enough supply, as low order value and high effort per transaction don&rsquo;t incentivize consumers. 
 <br>2) There&apos;s not enough demand, as the low supply volume is spread out over vast geographic areas.
 <br>
 <br>There&rsquo;s just not enough liquidity in most product categories for each geographic area to get the marketplaces rolling.<br><br>The How<br>To tackle the chicken-and-egg problem, Roju has launched in &lsquo;Single Player Mode&rsquo;, i.e. owning and controlling supply ourselves:
 <br>

Memocate Ltd.,,"The Pitch
 <br>Memocate is building a training service and an online community for dementia carers to help them interact better with persons with dementia.
 <br>
 <br>The What
 <br>People with dementia and their carers are in a vulnerable position. We want to help to make their voices heard and make sure that they are treated as persons and equals in our society. By improving professional caregivers and family member&apos;s interaction skills we aim to increase their well-being at work and generally in life.

MillenniumHus,,"The Pitch<br>We are not competing on the market, we are making new standards.
 <br>
 <br>MillenniumHus is a knowledge company that has developed and patentet valuable methods and products to be used to construct houses of all sizes.
 <br>-Astonishing savings of CO2 emissions.
 <br>-Industrialisation
 <br>-Lower building costs<br><br>The What<br>The housing construction market is one of the largest contributors to pollution in the world emitting huge amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere each year and has a rather poor utilization of natural resources.
 <br>In addition to the pollution of constructing a house, of any size, the energy needed to control the climate within the construction (heating/cooling) is very high and a large contributor to CO2 emissions, specially in colder climates in higher developed countries.
 <br>Of all methods of constructing a heated building, in colder climates, wooden houses are the ones that leave at least CO2 footprints. The disadvantage of the wooden houses in these demanding conditions is low life expectancy due to the breakdown of the construction which is of biological materials and cannot withstand very long the constant moisture and heat differences.
 <br>Failures in constructions are also very widespread and a growing problem in a world where lower demand for expertise is growing to gain more profits.<br><br>The How<br>The basic solution is very simple. We have built from there and ended up with very advanced and user friendly products.
 <br>We took the structural parts of the construction into the inside environment. 
 <br>By doing that the constructions most essential parts will never be exposed to the weather elements and seasonal changes. There will be no reason for the main construction to deteriorate since the climate it is standing in is controlled.
 <br>In addition to that we have been able, due to the structural design, to eliminate all thermal bridges. Thermal bridges have a huge role in lower energy efficiency and lead to deterioration of structures made from wood by &quot;creating&quot; suitable conditions for insects and microorganisms to thrive in and populate.
 <br>The method uses up to 48% less wood and 20% less isolation to gain the same results as known methods. <br><br>The Why<br>Ambition to reach perfection.
 <br>The method is not an idea that came like lighting a bulb one day and was taken from there. It is a development that started more then 25 years ago. That is the time that the innovator of the method has used to gain experience and perfection in his work that has been within new constructions and maintenance of constructions, contiunuusly for over 25 years.
 <br>The correct mind set, with the correct experience gained, in the right conditions and changes of demands of the marked with the combined focus on environment and solutions to pollution problems all came together, at the right time and the tight places and ended up with the method and products that MillenniumHus stands for.",http://www.millenniumhus.com,,,,,,Indirect,,,B2B,,Go to market,,,,,,,,Developed and emerging markets,,,2017,,,,,,,The Hub,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,Looking for funding,,  ,TRUE,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being,

 <br>But we cannot do it on our own.
 <br>Only us together can solve this mess.
 <br>It&rsquo;s just us!<br><br>The What<br>We are developing an independent system for monitoring and verifying the performance of smaller solar power installations owned by private customers or smaller enterprises. Today a solar power system is a rather big investment for most private customers or small companies, and many times they do not know if they are getting what they have payed for. They might be loosing out on performance that they should have been guaranteed by the manufacturer, and this might affect their payback time and also turn out to be a significant reduction in life-span of the system.
 <br>
 <br>Installers and vendors of solar power systems also suffer from bad quality of solar power modules. With our system they have a way of monitoring what they have installed and doing predictive maintenance, as well as making sure that they are not endorsing bad products.

 <br>Last but not least, we also offer tailored data from real world systems back to the manufacturers, for them to use in their research and development.
 <br>
 <br><br><br>The How<br>We are using an open-innovation and open-source approach, and through this we can make sure that we deliver our system at almost zero marginal cost, and thus making the system very cost-effective without letting down on quality and performance.

And when the two met over a beer to discuss life in the autumn of 2017 it turned out that both of them were ready for new challenges and adventures in the startup realm.

Our users open their homes and offer others to share dinner, fulfilling a market need for fun experiences and relations between visitors and locals.<br><br>The What<br>Many who are new to a city don&rsquo;t have a wide network outside their work/studies, and often eat dinner alone. Cooking a nice meal for one might be expensive and time consuming, so in many cases people end up buying take-away, as it is more convenient and cheaper, potentially resulting in loneliness and unhealthy diets. As more travelers visit the cities, more restaurants need to open and local shops close. This has led to a negative feel among locals, and a &ldquo;them vs. us&rdquo; mentality. In addition, there is a Western World trend towards nationalistic feelings and xenophobia, that contributes to a more divided world, enhancing the issue. For some people, it is challenging to embrace other cultures and they often fear what they don&rsquo;t know. Another negative point for society, is that when you buy products from supermarkets, they often come in bundled packages.

The need for engaging patient is even more, considering the ever increasing patient numbers and needs as well lower healthcare literacy rate among general population. Especially when most of the time patients are looking for the answers to following questions when they are outside of hospital settings:
 <br>&bull; What is my main problem?
 <br>&bull; What do I need to do?
 <br>&bull; Why is it important for me to do this?
 <br>
 <br>Hence the role of Doctors and healthcare professionals becomes more challenging, as they need to educate the patient as well. But then the shortage of time on healthcare professionals, a patient does not get satisfying or meaningful answers. That leads to poor or low treatment adherence.

In addition the cost of water is increasing and at the same time we need to produce more and more food with existing resources.<br><br>The How<br>Soil Scout has developed a unique technology to monitor critical growth conditions in agricultural sites and other artificially irrigated lands. The solution is a small, maintenance free sensor that is buried underground and it enables continuous soil monitoring, vertical profiling and detailed dynamic view to the soil parameters such as soil moisture, temperature and salinity (EC). This solution enables the users to keep up the optimal growth conditions without having to over-irrigate their land. With this technology the users are able to achieve significant savings in water and electricity and produce more crop by optimising the soil conditions.<br><br>The Why<br>In the early 2000s our founder 19th generation farmer, Dr Johannes Tiusanen started to think, that there has to be a way to understand what is happening under the surface of the field. At that time agronomists&apos; knew that more than 50% of the crop growth is happening underground but there wasn&apos;t any way to monitor it without interfering the growth. 
 <br>
 <br>The first idea was to attach a soil sensor to a mobile phone and bury it but it soon became obvious that there is no coverage underground.

 <br>One of the co-founders is of Asian origin (just like kombucha) and had been making kombucha at home since 2007, and the other co-founder is a sustainability nerd with an entrepreneurial drive that needs to be on a &quot;save the world&quot;-mission to thrive.

Our mission is to help break the destructive alcohol behavoiurs and norms by providing a delicious and attractive healthy alternative that you don&apos;t have to feel guilty for choosing when your peers might choose alcohol. We also want our product to appeal to wine drinkers and be a viable substitute for wine lovers. A sommelier that tasted our products were impressed so we feel confident we are on the right track.

Current education, according to research, stifles creativity by expecting students to conform.
 <br>In a rapidly changing world, people need innovative thinking and creativity to be able to shape their future. Thus, we need a new approach to education - one that prepares students for an unknown future. Yet, to date there are only scattered attempts to provide one.

Wholi,,"The Pitch<br>Wholi is a Copenhagen-based green and social startup with a vision to create a more sustainable and globally responsible food culture. 
 <br>
 <br>We do this by developing delicious and nutritious foods with insects, which we sell to western consumers; sharing knowledge about insects as a source of food; and supporting small-holder insect farmers in developing countries, presently cricket farmers in Cambodia.

 <br>Presently, we sell our products in more than 250 stores and fitness centres in DK,DE and UK.<br><br>The What<br>A sustainable and responsible food culture<br><br>The How<br>In the next 35 years, the global demand for food will increase 70%, according to the UN. The food industry is already having a significant impact on global warming and our consumption of meat is particularly troublesome for the climate. 
 <br> There is a need for attractive and tasty alternatives to meat that can provide high quality protein as well as other essential nutrients, while having a dramatically smaller CO2-footprint. 
 <br> Insects are a part of the solution, as they have an exceptional nutritional profile that can be compared to getting all the benefits from eating meat, fish and rye bread at once. Also, insects reproduce quickly, they can be farmed vertically, they require less land, 12 times less feed and 2000 times less water compared to producing beef; the equivalent of emitting 100 times less CO2. 
 <br>
 <br>The solution
 <br>The most important factor for creating this solution, however, is one of culture and habits. Wholi changes people&rsquo;s understanding of insects by creating wholesome and delicious foods presented in the most appetizing, so that people cannot resist trying. 
 <br> We started this company based on a vision for change and an urge to create a solution that can help solve issues related to climate change and malnutrition. The two founders have complimentary backgrounds from agricultural development (specialized in edible insects) and business development. We are passionate about building a sustainable company that can take advantage of the growing need for innovative alternatives in order to create impact and financial growth. We are inspired by the rich cultures around the world that for centuries have embraced eating insects, and support smallholder cricket farmers in Cambodia through knowledge sharing.

Water shortage is caused both by draught due to increasingly volatile weather conditions, increasing urbanization and wealth leading to higher demand for water. In Cape Town during Spring 2018, the city was close to running dry &ndash; only by appealing heavily to the inhabitants and due to rain Cape Town managed to postpone the water crises. Also, due to the lack of water in summer 2018, UK officials urged the citizens to shower no longer than 4 minutes. These examples emphasize the importance to act. Desalting of seawater is one of the actions carried out to try and solve the issue of water shortage. However, this process is both costly as well as energy intensive, leading to potential higher CO2 emissions. Also, water cleaning is a solution but still being experimental technology and not yet proven to be full scale functional.<br><br><br>The How<br>Aguardio is a physical device designed to guide people in a more sustainable direction. Installed in the bathroom, Aguardio facilitates changes in shower behaviour with the aim to reduce water and energy consumption. Aguardio consists of two devices: a sensor placed at the ceiling in the shower cabinet, and a display placed on the wall in the shower cabinet. The sensor collects data on shower behaviour via different individual sensors, e.g movement, acoustic, humidity, temperature etc which are uploaded to a cloud for further analysis. As soon as a shower starts, the wall-mounted display is activated, illustrating shower time. This means, that the display timer stops if water is turned off e.g. while shampooing, and the total bath length is shown when the user leaves the shower cabinet. Pilot test shows​ that Aguardio can reduce the shower time by 20 percent per shower.<br><br>The Why<br>Climate change and water shortage have become worldwide challenges, which needs to be addressed.

 <br>We have cut all expensive intermediaries as much as possible, so as much as possible is landing in the manufacturer&apos;s own pocket.

 <br>
 <br>Therefore, we emphasize that our producers protect nature and actively work to maintain local biodiversity. Therefore, we support projects that educate coffee farmers to streamline and develop their production so that they can exist side by side with the natural animal and plant life.

Better World Fashion,,"The Pitch<br>Better World Fashion (BWF) is a fashion brand that collects recycled leather and prolonging their life by re-working and up-cycling. BWF offer the new reworked leather jackets to consumers via leasing/buyback agreements. This secures that the leather stay in rotation and never gets disposed. Storytelling and individualization is a vital part of BWF as we capture the individual jacket&rsquo;s story and making sure that it gets told.<br><br>The What<br>Creating a platform for sustanable consumption<br><br>The How<br>Better World Fashion is an award-winning sustainable pioneer and we have been rewarded for our ground-breaking, disruptive journey. The renowned Ellen Mac Arthur Foundation, the world&apos;s leading expert on the circular economy, has published a case study about Better World Fashion. We are B-Corp certified and the first Danish company ever, that received the &apos;Best for the Environment&apos; certificate in 2017 and 2018. Our jackets are 98% re-use, 100% unique, Danish Design, made in Europe. 
 <br>The objective of BWF is to promote and inspire sustainable alternatives to the traditional business models within the textile industry. The business model is based on a circular philosophy, which accommodates the current consumption patterns in a more sustainable way. The circular business model of BWF revolves around following concepts. 
 <br>
 <br>Reworked leather: BWF uses only sustainable materials in their jackets such as recycled lining and recycled leather. As opposed to traditional recycling, BWF reworks recycled leather by collecting, disassembling and redesigning it into new leather jackets from different pieces of recycled leather. This secures better resource exploitation, as the leather is kept in circulation thereby prolonging its lifespan. The circular philosophy is particularly suitable in relation to leather, as high quality leather is highly durable and thus possesses the ability to be recycled and reworked into new pieces of clothing. 
 <br>
 <br>Storytelling: Since each jacket is constructed from different pieces of reworked skin, each jacket is unique and has its own story, which is communicated to the consumer. As such each jacket can be traced back to their previous owners. BWF intends to write pedigrees for each jacket, which will be updated continuously and communicated to the consumer each time a jacket is delivered to the consumer. 
 <br>
 <br>Leasing and buy back: A central part of the business model is the consumer can rent a jacket or buy with a unlimited buyback guarantee.<br><br>The Why<br>The world is in need of something new.Not new things.

Laws and regulations are not a fit solution. <br><br>We need to change the way we cook and the way we shop.<br><br>Everyone uses recipes for centuries to learn how to cook new meals. It is however difficult to find recipes that match your needs and especially hard to find recipes that only use ingredients you have at home.<br><br>The How<br>Plant Jammer leveraged machine and human intelligence alike to discover patterns in recipes. We uncovered modules that make up a well balanced dish and we trained a machine learning model to predict the best maches to your ingredients. We can use this in a simple journey where you create a recipe yourself in a step by step fashion.

GoSol,,"The Pitch<br>GoSol.solar&apos;s SOL5 is a cost-effective technology for concentrating sunlight for thermal needs. Our aim is to break the cost-barriers currently limiting deployment of solar thermal technologies in both industrial and local entrepreneurial applications. We are on a mission to make people&rsquo;s lives richer, breathe easier and make the environment cleaner through our GoSol scalable solar tech. We support the transition towards a massive use of clean energy for all.<br><br>The What<br>Mitigate climate change impact for SMEs<br><br>The How<br>It all started as a great adventure to participate to climate change mitigation and solve energy poverty (lack of clean energy access among farmers and SME&apos;s in developing countries). If we could increase the wealth of local entrepreneurs, this would create more local stability, more clean energy and food security, and less deforestation of course. 
 <br>
 <br>Solar panels can provide electricity but have limiting factors: they are mostly made in China with huge impact on climate during fabrication and shipping, and they cannot provide high temperature heat needed to power activities (in many sectors most of the energy need is heat). 
 <br>
 <br>So, we started to work on Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) solutions for SME&apos;s. One of our 1st prototype was used by a Mexican cooperative to roast chocolate. 
 <br>
 <br>After that 1st success, our team was keen to solve more technical challenges, one of them being to be able to build in any country with local material. So we continued the R&amp;D process in Mali, Haiti, Mexico, France, Cuba, India, Switzerland, Finland, Canada.
 <br>
 <br>Then we decided to structure things and to start a start-up and we choose Finland because of the very healthy business practices and innovative start-up landascape. Operations started in 2015 when we did consultancies to solve thermal engineering issues with our innovative software. Then we also partnered with the NGO World Vision. 
 <br>
 <br>With them, we piloted our first SOL5 solar concentrators in Kenya with bakers and organic peanut butter producers. They adopted SOL5 immediately and are still using it. SOL5 improves the quality of their products, it also saves money on electricity and charcoal bill.
 <br>
 <br>A 2d wave of successful pilots was made possible last year with financing from Autodesk Foundation and from W&auml;rtsil&auml;. The ROI is now less of 18 months.

If Norway&apos;s largest lake is the size of a pea, the Aral Sea is a medicine ball. Or it was. Today the Aral Sea has shrunk to about 5 % of its original size. The main reason for the change is cotton plantations, and their huge irrigation systems. To produce a t-shirt you need 15 bath tubs with water, just to grow the cotton.
 <br>
 <br>To produce one t-shirt made of conventional cotton you need a water glass with highly toxic chemicals. Poor farmers get ill when spraying their fields with it.

Every major car manufacturer is now bringing mid-priced electric vehicles for mass markets. Some have even announced to end the production of gasoline cars. States in wide spectrum have decided to ban all new fossil fuel cars. As the prices go down, the adoption of electric vehicles can be as disruptive as the as for the smart phone outdating the older cell phone. Only one problem has remained: How to charge the car in real estate environment. 
 <br>
 <br>The current method of installing single chargers here and there is expensive and cumbersome. Each new set of chargers implies a new project with electrical engineering, acquisition of chargers and electrical contracting. The limits of electrical distribution center can suddenly form a barrier for adding new chargers. These difficulties have prompted the experts to forecast that the problem of charging in real estate will substantially slow down the adoption of electric vehicles. That has been the case, until now. 
 <br>
 <br>Parking Energy Platform solves all the issues with a single stroke. The crucial distinction is to separate the cabling from the chargers. In the heart of the solution is a quick connector: In a garage, the cabling can be brought to each slot, ending to a robust and inexpensive connector. When the tenant buys an electric vehicle, the charger can be ordered to the parking slot for the next day. The installment of a charger with fitting quick connector is plug-and-play. It takes only a minute and requires no electrical planning or composing official electrical installment records.
 <br>The benefit for the real estate owner is twofold. 
 <br>
 <br>First, a large parking area can be prepared to be EV-ready with a single investment.

Lumine Lighting Solutions Oy,,"The Pitch<br>We are changing outdoor lighting by providing &quot;light on demand&quot;. In other words, by utilizing our technology, the illumination of empty streets may be minimized while still providing the occasional pedestrian or car a well lit field of view. Compared to traditional lighting control, we save up to 80 % of the energy consumed by outdoor lighting without compromising public safety or comfortability gained by lighting.<br><br>The What<br>Street lighting = Smart lighting<br><br>The How<br>Lumine was founded by three students from different engineering background. The idea behind Lumine was born from a cross-country skiing path which was well lit but rarely used. Santeri Oksanen thought this was waste of energy and started building Lumine&apos;s team which few years after that launched the first smart lighting project in Espoo.
 <br>
 <br>First years went by developing the solution and providing information to city officials about smart lighting. Over 4 years have gone by and now Lumine&apos;s solutions is utilized in pedestrian streets, bicycle streets, roads and several other sights in over 15 cities. 
 <br>
 <br>Lumine control system provides energy savings between 40 and 80 %. In addition to financial savings and reduced carbon footprint, Lumine&apos;s solution also eliminates excess light pollution. This is done via Lumine 180 control unit which is sold directly to cities and agencies who are responsible of street lighting.
 <br>
 <br>We are offering two main products: Lumine 180 is installed on the pole so it can be used with any led-luminaire. Lumine 180 INT has the same functionalities with Lumine 180 except it will be installed inside the luminaire to reduce the installation cost of the unit. Most of our business is hardware sales but in addition we collect a maintenance fee of the smart lighting service.
 <br>
 <br>Our goal is to be the biggest smart lighting provider in the Nordic countries within next three years. In addition to smart lighting we are looking to provide other services through our wireless network. For example we are able to calculate the traffic in every pole to be utilized in city planning. Also additional sensors and cameras in the network can provide essential information for road maintenance.<br><br>The Why<br>Our goal is to minimize the energy consumption in lighting while still providing comfortable lighting for everyone.",http://www.lumine.fi,,,,,,Indirect,,,B2B,,Growth and expansion,,,,,,,,Developed and emerging markets,,,2013,1-10,,,,,,The Hub,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,Looking for funding,,  ,TRUE,TRUE,  ,  ,TRUE,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,SDG 4: Quality Education,

 <br>them, restoring faith and hope for the future - and help break the cycle of poverty.

 <br>Our main market is West Africa (380 million people), starting in Gambia (2 million people). By producing locally we make the region less dependant on imports and foreign exchange.

 <br>
 <br>The co-founder Elizabeth Gomez is born and raised in Gambia and knows how important it is to get a real job. All changes start with having a reliable income.
 <br>
 <br>We want to provide this reliable income by producing something everyone needs and wants - quality comfortable underwear which lasts for a long time.
 <br>
 <br>After several years of thinking about what kind of business to start, we finally decided on underwear since that&apos;s what Elizabeths friends and relatives in Gambia always asked her to bring on her visits to Gambia. In most African countries today it&apos;s only possible to buy second hand underwear or really low quality underwear.
 <br>
 <br>After a lot of research we started our business in February 2017 by investing our own money, working with with very experienced people from Sweden and UK to design our underwear and train our staff on site in Gambia.
 <br>
 <br>After months of training, we started selling in Gambia in July 2017. At first we sold directly from our factory, but in November 2017 we established commission agreements with two of Gambias top fashion boutiques.
 <br>
 <br>In December 2017 we participated in the countries biggest fashion event, Fashion Weekend Gambia, as the first underwear brand ever.
 <br>
 <br>During our first year of operation we have received a lot of interest and people really want to buy our products. Our production costs are still a bit too high, so we need to scale up to be able to buy larger volumes of fabrics to get the prices down. We also need to invest more in skills training to improve our efficiency.

3A Water,,"Our product is a measurement system for analyzing low levels of dissolved metals in water. The portable device provides precise real-time on-site results in field conditions. At the core of the technology is a filter, about the size of a 10 euro cent coin, made of our proprietary nanomaterial. A water sample is pumped through the filter, which collects metal ions from the liquid. The metals are concentrated up to 200 times in the filter compared to the original water sample. The high concentration of the metals in the filter makes it possible to measure them with a portable and affordable X-ray fluorescence (XRF) sensor, which on its own is not sensitive enough to measure the water samples. The original metal concentrations in water are calculated based on XRF measurements by our calibration algorithm.

 <br>We offer a portable device for measuring metal content of water on-site in real time. The technology brings great benefits compared to old-fashioned laboratory measurements.

 <br>Solid oxide fuel cell&rsquo;s (SOFC) are a unique technology in many ways. A SOFC power generator is unparalleled in efficiency by any other type of power conversion technology, independent of scale, in a single cycle, and it is inherently modular.
 <br>
 <br>High operating temperature of solid oxide fuel cells makes these systems flexible for operating on different fuel compositions. Due to clean, hot exhaust gas, SOFC systems are also ideal for combined heat and power generation omitting transmission and distribution losses of power and heat networks.

Clean Sea Solutions,Preventing and Reducing Marine Pollution,"Clean Sea Solutions AS (est. Jan 2018) is a Norwegian Ocean Tech company that develops innovative solutions to prevent and reduce plastic waste in the sea. Our products are designed to collect plastic waste in and below the water surface in lakes, canals, rivers and river mouths, harbors, marinas, and other waterfront areas.
 <br>
 <br>The problem we are working to solve
 <br>Between 4,8 and 12,7 million tons of plastic ends in the oceans every year, the main problem is the release of plastic waste into the ocean through waterways, rivers, harbor areas, and other areas close to the coast.
 <br>
 <br>The solution is to gather the waste in the water bodies close to the polluting sources by a moving or stationary floating device with a practical and right-sized collecting and storage system.
 <br>
 <br>The increased focus on plastic waste in the ocean specifically, and the protection of the environment in general, leads cities and other waterway owners to search for new cleaning options. Several do this manually or with crudely adapted boats. The response from the market is that this kind of collection system &ndash; its size, focus area, operation mode, and autonomous operation mode &ndash; fits the need of many cities.
 <br>
 <br>Products 
 <br>The Clean Sea Aqua Drone is an all-electric, autonomous floating waste-collecting Aqua drone, combining robotic technology with modern and efficient design with the purpose of capturing plastic waste in the water surface, and built to be easily emptied. Providing clean waters in ports, marinas, and waterways, protecting marine habitats. Added value stream mapping and data collection
 <br>
 <br>The Clean Sea Flexi Pods are flexible and attractive modular floating docks with built-in autonomous waste collectors and internal collection pools, designed to keep marinas and private waterfront estates clean from floating plastic waste and thus reduce the inflow of waste into the open seas
 <br>
 <br>Impact 
 <br>Plastic waste will be collected before it is dissolved or reaches the high seas. The effect can be measured in the volume of plastic collected. 
 <br>We are advancing the Sustainable Development Goals, especially SDG14 (Life Below Water) by contributing to reducing plastic pollution and contributing to the sustainability of the ocean - SDG6 (Clean Water Sanitation) by improving the quality and sustainability of water resources by addressing the impact of plastic waste inflow.
 <br>
 <br>Focus of activities 
 <br>Our focus of business is an area identified for maximum effectiveness; Rivers, river mouths, harbors, marinas, resorts, and waterfront urban development areas. Especially the Mediterranean region, where significant resources have been allocated to France, Spain, and Italy through the Mediterranean Action Plan. This market is estimated to increase to 10.2% by 2024, compared to 8% in 2018. Africa is another priority region where 70 million metric tons of waste are generated each year, but only 10 percent is collected. By 2025, over
 <br>160 million metric tons of waste will be generated annually, and much of it will end up in the sea due to a lack of proper waste treatment.
 <br>
 <br>Assumptions 
 <br>We believe, based on current trends that 5 years from now, every waterfront area with human activity will either have an active cleaning system for its waters or a strong push to install such a system. Where no regulations or laws exist or are effective, NGOs and other stakeholders will demand and support the installation of a system. Public demand will play a major role in resorts and other private waterfront areas. Clean waters and environmentally friendly solutions will become a competitive advantage within an increasing number of business areas

Re:newcell,,"We make fashion sustainable.<br><br>Before a shirt is worn for the first time it has been through more steps than most customers realize. Often one producer makes the yarn, another knits or weaves it into textile fabric, and a third makes the shirt from the fabric. Now it&rsquo;s ready for the customer to wear.When garments are worn out or no longer wanted some are sold second-hand or used as hand-me-downs, but the vast majority end up in landfills or are incinerated. Much too few are recycled due to the fact that cotton and viscose can&rsquo;t be recycled with satisfactory quality on a large enough scale. The cycle stops, because there is a hole in the loop, a crucial part is missing. <br><br>Our recycling technology dissolves used cotton and other natural fibers into a new, biodegradable raw material, Circulose pulp. It can be turned into textile fiber, be fed into the textile production cycle and meet industry specifications. This is the link that has been missing from the cycle. We have closed the loop. The way fashion is produced and consumed can finally be transformed into a never-ending loop.<br><br>If the world&rsquo;s population increases as expected, there will be 8.5 billion people by 2030. And as the population grows, apparel consumption grows with it. But producing even more apparel will have significant impact on water use, CO2 emissions, use of chemicals and waste disposal. It&rsquo;s not sustainable. Something has to change. Our process of recycling cotton fibers and viscose fibers uses less water and chemicals, emits less CO2 and prolongs the usage of the world&rsquo;s resources. More used cotton garments can be collected and the volume of garments made from our recycled, biodegradable textile fibers can increase.

 <br>
 <br>One of the most demanding challenges of the mining and other industries are the ever tightening effluent requirements, particularly concerning discharges of sulfate containing waste waters into the receiving watercourses. The leading principle of the Sulfator-method is to transform sulfate energy efficiently in process waters into sulfur-rich raw materials which can be utilized either in the original process or sold to an external client. The Sulfator-method enables the recycling of sulfate and production process waters creating thus a solid basis for the sustainable development of the mining and other industries.
 <br>
 <br>The process is based on the microbiological refining of sulfate to sulfide and from there to reusable products. The process enables the recycling of sulfur and water.
